A million things to remember. A million things to let go of, but not this one please not this one. I hadn’t warned her about the crash, the withdrawal, the jump.

I stood in the dead-center of the Scrambler for hours, scanning fruitlessly for it, baking in asphalt-heat, roasting in my scales and jewels. Now the truth was undeliable.

<p class="p1">It was actually more like waist deep but I guess that depends on, oh God, there were two of us, and which was I? Only with Cai’s eyes I finally saw what I was doing, that the entire flat was filled with water. Every tap had been running for hours, since I got home, and just how long had that been?

<p class="p1">But there was no time at all. The Weather Bureau was already in the building, already there to mop up the damage. Probably this same scene was playing out all across the city.
