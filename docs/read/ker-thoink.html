<p class="p1">“Let me see it,” I shout when I come down, flipping up the hood, ripping out the tube. “Let me —”</p>
<p class="p1">I make it two steps out of the scanner, but I can’t hold back the nausea. Tethi, bless him, is holding a bucket. And when I look a little better, he hands me a little bottle of water. “I’m sorry. Not to have warned you, primed you, whatever. But there’s nobody I can go to. You have no idea what a relief it is that you found it too.”</p>
<p class="p1">“No, <i>no, no, no...</i>you don’t understand,” I insist weakly. Retch again. “People see things in there all the time, but it’s just delusion, it’s...” What was the word the Weather Bureau used? “It’s maladaptive...”</p>
<p class="p1">“I thought that too, for a while. It’s how I justified selling it.” He smiles faintly, and I’m aware now of how foolish I sound explaining the Mirror Sea to a Chalker. Maybe a Chalker? <i>There are layers to it,</i> he’d said. “It’s in the printer,” he says now. “You said you wanted to see it.”</p>
<p class="p1">Another copy of the Sunflower Sieve egg thunks into the tray. Fresh, icy understanding spreads to my fingertips as I pick it up. And I pause. Saying it makes it real. “I meant…their city. That place. I’m…it’s crazy how much I can’t remember already. I need to see it in soberspace.”</p>
<p class="p1">“You can’t. Not really.” He taps a hefty grey box near the monitors. “This right here is a convolution coprocessor. Every Mirror Sea display in the city uses one to find interesting correlations. But a good neikonaut can blow a whole room of them out of the water. I’ll show you what it can piece together, but prepare to be underwhelmed.”</p>
<p class="p1">He has a flat view of the Sea up now on one of the monitors. He flicks his wrists, panning and zooming. “Look. This was the night I found it.” A dull grey Sea, roughly nothing, though the poor contrast of his monitor doesn’t help. Infrequently there are dim, spectral intrusions of sunlight, that’s all. “Uhh, <i>here.</i>” More nothing. Then a dim, silent, spherical flash of gold light.</p>
<p class="p1">I’m locked and loaded to insist that this doesn’t prove anything. But then he plucks one of the Sieve eggs off the table with a theatrical flick. “<i>This</i> is what I saw and printed that night. Now, time passes, day, night, day, night…watch carefully, they test-fire it a few more times…”</p>
<p class="p1">“<i>Test-fire</i> it?”</p>
<p class="p1">The feed slows. Night falls on Shanghai, and night falls in the Sea, except for one insistent little pinprick, a tiny sun that won’t set. And then another, and another, three more now. It’s tentative, like a flame in wind, and then fierce, like a flame in wind, until the Sea is laced with a whole network of golden fissures. “That was the night that <i>this</i> leaked online.” He picks up the second egg now, offers both for my examination. They’re <i>different</i>, subtly so, in the details of the flecks and the tubules. A parallax view, the same egg discovered twice...</p>
<p class="p1">“Someone else is seeing this,” I mutter. I take it back;<i> this</i> is what makes it real. “I thought, that night at Double Descent, that you dropped it. That someone else picked it up and put it online.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Then you don’t yet know me very well.” He wags a finger, smiling, trying to be funny. “Don’t let go of what you already have. That’s just about my number one rule.”</p>
<p class="p1">I don’t smile back. I focus just past it, a flash of something reflective, and probing it as the diving-bell. The hollow, barely-recalled horror of wondering which side of some ragged mirror I was on. <i>You looked too hard, </i>hisses something awful inside me. It insists that I caused this, even though <i>I know</i> that doesn’t make any sense. It’s got Tethi too. It’s what he’s been trying to drink away…</p>
<p class="p1">“Mona?”</p>
<p class="p1">He catches me just before I hit the floor.</p>
</section>
<section>
<p class="p1"><i>I just need to lie down for a while.</i> My body is taking this like an infection, fighting it with a fever. Tethi takes me to the roof of Old New Prosperity. It’s the first truly cool night of autumn. He sets me up with musty microfiber blankets, plus a chipped mug of chamomile, his idea of a joke. I don’t speak for a long time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">I have waterlogged, chewed-through foundations that must finally come down, and nothing to replace them. Everything I ever heard about the Ripples comes back as a needling, random-access prickle, and I recast it through this image of them <i>operating machinery</i> in their own world. Their agency is supposed to be faint and illusory. Their motion is supposed to be borrowed from ours. If they can be said to be doing anything at all, they are ultimately and inevitably doing it <i>here.</i></p>
<p class="p1">Something is hiding in the texture of time. And if that weren’t enough, something else is making a periodic <i>ker-thoink</i> sound that’s driving me absolutely crazy<i>. </i>Through stray, fever-slick strands of hair, I see Tethi bouncing a rubber ball against a concrete backstop. <i>Ker-thoink.</i> It ricochets off the ground, against the wall, and back into his hand. But I have become deeply unmoored, so that the cause-and-effect of ball, wall, gravity, and hand is…doing a thing. A <i>stare into the dot</i> <i>and the lines will wiggle</i> thing. A <i>how do these lights get so tangled just sitting in the box</i> thing.</p>
<p class="p1">“Could you please stop that…” I groan, just now sitting up.</p>
<p class="p1">“Watch it move,” Tethi tells me. Three short English words. He looks relieved to hear me up and speaking. <i>Ker-thoink. </i>And something about watching the ball does it. It all reels up rather imperfectly, but Tethi and Mona snap back into focus.</p>
<p class="p1">“Should have warned you before I put you in. Don’t take it right to the head,” he says, gluing English to Mandarin by way of French. “In there you need to be perceiving things <i>obliquely,</i> yeah? Not looking directly at them.”</p>
<p class="p1">I have only an inkling of what he means, so I choose to keep focusing on the ball. “It bounces?” I ask. Because, thanks to a glint of moonlight, I’ve realized it’s actually one of his Sieve orbs. “The Sunflower Sieve bounces.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Nothing in the Soup about it yet.” <i>Ker-thoink.</i></p>
<p class="p1">“No one’s tried dropping one, I guess.”</p>
<p class="p1"><i>Ker-thoink. </i>“Could be your next big paper.”</p>
<p class="p1">The orb hits his palm with a satisfying smack. For a minute of pleasant silence, through an unlikely gap in the skyline, we enjoy a clear view of distant and twinkling Pudong. Blurry Ripples crawl the twist of the Suowei Tower.</p>
<p class="p1">“Mona — I can call you that, yes?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Well, it’s sure as shit not Dr. Xu,” I lob back, but politely. I have the egg now and I’m very much enjoying its <i>ker-thoink.</i></p>
<p class="p1">“Mona. I said earlier I was going to ask a favor of you. So I’m just going to come right out and say it. No preamble or anything. But I think it’s justified. I think I’d do well.” He rocks back and forth a little. He looks pretty nervous for a maybe-kinda Chalker, for a hardened refugee of the Gabonese Fork. “Take me to YINS.”</p>
<p class="p1">I give him a look. “What do you mean, take you?”</p>
<p class="p1">“I mean take me. Introduce me to people. Get me involved.” He falters, a rehearsed argument melting in his mouth. “Straight up, I want what you have. You’re working under Deng Jinghan, you know how many people would kill for that?”</p>
<p class="p1">I laugh bitterly, and he takes it the wrong way.</p>
<p class="p1">“No. Fuck that. I’ve been laughed out of too many rooms in this city. They laughed me out of the room at Suowei and Paracoin, and I learned to wipe the floor with their traders. They turned me down at Kanwei, and I built a scanner out of scraps. And now I’m sitting on a revelation. You and I are, now. <i>Think about what I just showed you.</i> The Ripples are building something —”</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s not possible!” I shout, still feverish, newly shaken. “Please stop saying that!”</p>
<p class="p1">“It is possible,” he insists flatly. “It wouldn’t be, if the Mirror Sea was only what’s on those screens. But I’ve seen too much to believe that.” He fixes his gaze on my forearm where the moonlight, the right light, reveals remnants of my sigil tattoo. “And I think you have too.”</p>
<p class="p1">A trillion once-unseen coincidences woven together by a billion eyes. The slow, impossible, inevitable accretion of stability, unfolding of patterns, dripping of glass. The curves tug and tighten, indistinguishable from need, from agency, from life. The Ripples aren’t what’s on those screens. They’re what <i>we</i> see there. So of course<i> </i>they want. Of course they create. We’ve watched them too closely, let them too deep into our minds. And now we’ve given them lightning from their crystalline sky, a stranger kind of fire.</p>
<p class="p1">We’ve given them neikotics. And they’ve built a city of what we took for debris.</p>
<p class="p1">“I think about what to do with this,” Tethi starts again, slowly, deliberately. “I think the Chalk knows, in its own way. I think the Weather Bureau knows <i>something</i>, because they’re looking for me now, and if they catch me they’ll never let me go. So where do I turn? Blue Delta? The Big Three? I’ve thought it over and over and over, and at the end of the day I trust YINS. I trust you. So let me help you handle it safely. Let me in.”</p>
<p class="p1">I whip the Sieve egg at the wall, relieved at the predictable way it moves under familiar forces. Resenting that: wishing for a wider mind, ample space to fit new ways of seeing as they come. The orb takes a weird hop. Flies past my face and into Tethi’s outstretched hand.</p>
<p class="p1">“And I’m a hell of an engineer,” he adds. “I belong at YINS. Tell me I don’t, or introduce me to Deng Jinghan.”</p>
<p class="p1">I scan his face for the usual twitch of smile, of self-deprecation, but why the fuck should I expect to find it? The man built a loop-lock rig from scavenged parts and wired it into the Mirror Sea. Of course he deserves to be at YINS. Probably more than I do.</p>
<p class="p1">“You know this is insane, right?”</p>
<p class="p1">“I know I need to leave this place before it kills me. I was only ever supposed to be here a week.” He gazes out towards Triple Point, down towards Min’s shop across the courtyard, lights blazing past midnight, and I know he’s thinking about what he’ll tell her. “I know I can’t waltz into a position at YINS. So tell me how to impress them. One shot.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah. Yeah. Wait. Hold on.” For a second there I was getting choked up, a little, maybe. But something is coming together. “Hold the fuck on. You’re an electrical engineer. You<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>can work with readonly nets, beamformers, all that good stuff?”</p>
<p class="p1">The way he nods, I might have asked whether he can tie his shoes.</p>
<p class="p1">“You wanna help me run an experiment?”</p>

scanner, but I can’t hold back the nausea. Tethi, bless him, is holding a bucket. And when I look a little better, he hands me a little bottle of water. “I’m sorry. Not to have warned you, primed you, whatever. But there’s nobody I can go to. You have no idea what a relief it is that you found it too.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“No, \u003ci\u003eno, no, no...\u003c/i\u003eyou don’t understand,” I insist weakly. Retch again. “People see things in there all the time, but it’s just delusion, it’s...” What was the word the Weather Bureau used? “It’s maladaptive...”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“I thought that too, for a while. It’s how I justified selling it.” He smiles faintly, and I’m aware now of how foolish I sound explaining the Mirror Sea to a Chalker. Maybe a Chalker? \u003ci\u003eThere are layers to it,\u003c/i\u003e he’d said. “It’s in the printer,” he says now. “You said you wanted to see it.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eAnother copy of the Sunflower Sieve egg thunks into the tray. Fresh, icy understanding spreads to my fingertips as I pick it up. And I pause. Saying it makes it real. “I meant…their city. That place. I’m…it’s crazy how much I can’t remember already. I need to see it in soberspace.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“You can’t. Not really.” He taps a hefty grey box near the monitors. “This right here is a convolution coprocessor. Every Mirror Sea display in the city uses one to find interesting correlations. But a good neikonaut can blow a whole room of them out of the water. I’ll show you what it can piece together, but prepare to be underwhelmed.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eHe has a flat view of the Sea up now on one of the monitors. He flicks his wrists, panning and zooming. “Look. This was the night I found it.” A dull grey Sea, roughly nothing, though the poor contrast of his monitor doesn’t help. Infrequently there are dim, spectral intrusions of sunlight, that’s all. “Uhh, \u003ci\u003ehere.\u003c/i\u003e” More nothing. Then a dim, silent, spherical flash of gold light.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eI’m locked and loaded to insist that this doesn’t prove anything. But then he plucks one of the Sieve eggs off the table with a theatrical flick. “\u003ci\u003eThis\u003c/i\u003e is what I saw and printed that night. Now, time passes, day, night, day, night…watch carefully, they test-fire it a few more times…”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“\u003ci\u003eTest-fire\u003c/i\u003e it?”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eThe feed slows. Night falls on Shanghai, and night falls in the Sea, except for one insistent little pinprick, a tiny sun that won’t set. And then another, and another, three more now. It’s tentative, like a flame in wind, and then fierce, like a flame in wind, until the Sea is laced with a whole network of golden fissures. “That was the night that \u003ci\u003ethis\u003c/i\u003e leaked online.” He picks up the second egg now, offers both for my examination. They’re \u003ci\u003edifferent\u003c/i\u003e, subtly so, in the details of the flecks and the tubules. A parallax view, the same egg discovered twice...\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“Someone else is seeing this,” I mutter. I take it back;\u003ci\u003e this\u003c/i\u003e is what makes it real. “I thought, that night at Double Descent, that you dropped it. That someone else picked it up and put it online.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“Then you don’t yet know me very well.” He wags a finger, smiling, trying to be funny. “Don’t let go of what you already have. That’s just about my number one rule.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eI don’t smile back. I focus just past it, a flash of something reflective, and probing it as the diving-bell. The hollow, barely-recalled horror of wondering which side of some ragged mirror I was on. \u003ci\u003eYou looked too hard, \u003c/i\u003ehisses something awful inside me. It insists that I caused this, even though \u003ci\u003eI know\u003c/i\u003e that doesn’t make any sense. It’s got Tethi too. It’s what he’s been trying to drink away…\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“Mona?”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eHe catches me just before I hit the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/section\u003e\\n\u003csection\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eI just need to lie down for a while.\u003c/i\u003e My body is taking this like an infection, fighting it with a fever. Tethi takes me to the roof of Old New Prosperity. It’s the first truly cool night of autumn. He sets me up with musty microfiber blankets, plus a chipped mug of chamomile, his idea of a joke.

Everything I ever heard about the Ripples comes back as a needling, random-access prickle, and I recast it through this image of them \u003ci\u003eoperating machinery\u003c/i\u003e in their own world. Their agency is supposed to be faint and illusory. Their motion is supposed to be borrowed from ours.

And if that weren’t enough, something else is making a periodic \u003ci\u003eker-thoink\u003c/i\u003e sound that’s driving me absolutely crazy\u003ci\u003e. \u003c/i\u003eThrough stray, fever-slick strands of hair, I see Tethi bouncing a rubber ball against a concrete backstop. \u003ci\u003eKer-thoink.\u003c/i\u003e It ricochets off the ground, against the wall, and back into his hand. But I have become deeply unmoored, so that the cause-and-effect of ball, wall, gravity, and hand is…doing a thing. A \u003ci\u003estare into the dot\u003c/i\u003e \u003ci\u003eand the lines will wiggle\u003c/i\u003e thing.

Three short English words. He looks relieved to hear me up and speaking. \u003ci\u003eKer-thoink. \u003c/i\u003eAnd something about watching the ball does it. It all reels up rather imperfectly, but Tethi and Mona snap back into focus.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“Should have warned you before I put you in. Don’t take it right to the head,” he says, gluing English to Mandarin by way of French. “In there you need to be perceiving things \u003ci\u003eobliquely,\u003c/i\u003e yeah? Not looking directly at them.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eI have only an inkling of what he means, so I choose to keep focusing on the ball. “It bounces?” I ask.

So I’m just going to come right out and say it. No preamble or anything. But I think it’s justified. I think I’d do well.” He rocks back and forth a little. He looks pretty nervous for a maybe-kinda Chalker, for a hardened refugee of the Gabonese Fork. “Take me to YINS.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eI give him a look. “What do you mean, take you?”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“I mean take me. Introduce me to people. Get me involved.” He falters, a rehearsed argument melting in his mouth. “Straight up, I want what you have.

I’ve been laughed out of too many rooms in this city. They laughed me out of the room at Suowei and Paracoin, and I learned to wipe the floor with their traders.

You and I are, now. \u003ci\u003eThink about what I just showed you.\u003c/i\u003e The Ripples are building something —”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“It’s not possible!” I shout, still feverish, newly shaken. “Please stop saying that!”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“It is possible,” he insists flatly. “It wouldn’t be, if the Mirror Sea was only what’s on those screens.

The slow, impossible, inevitable accretion of stability, unfolding of patterns, dripping of glass. The curves tug and tighten, indistinguishable from need, from agency, from life. The Ripples aren’t what’s on those screens. They’re what \u003ci\u003ewe\u003c/i\u003e see there. So of course\u003ci\u003e \u003c/i\u003ethey want. Of course they create. We’ve watched them too closely, let them too deep into our minds. And now we’ve given them lightning from their crystalline sky, a stranger kind of fire.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eWe’ve given them neikotics. And they’ve built a city of what we took for debris.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“I think about what to do with this,” Tethi starts again, slowly, deliberately. “I think the Chalk knows, in its own way. I think the Weather Bureau knows \u003ci\u003esomething\u003c/i\u003e, because they’re looking for me now, and if they catch me they’ll never let me go. So where do I turn? Blue Delta? The Big Three? I’ve thought it over and over and over, and at the end of the day I trust YINS. I trust you. So let me help you handle it safely. Let me in.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eI whip the Sieve egg at the wall, relieved at the predictable way it moves under familiar forces. Resenting that: wishing for a wider mind, ample space to fit new ways of seeing as they come. The orb takes a weird hop. Flies past my face and into Tethi’s outstretched hand.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“And I’m a hell of an engineer,” he adds. “I belong at YINS.

So tell me how to impress them. One shot.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“Yeah. Yeah. Wait. Hold on.” For a second there I was getting choked up, a little, maybe.
