<p class="p1">What happens when we look away?</p>
<p class="p1">Take as your focus a cloud in the distance, unknowably large and far away, and try to understand that you contain it. Know that large as the sky is, you are larger still; revel in the distance to your own horizon. Now take as your focus your hand, and try to understand it as a construct of sense and memory, a projection of mind on mind. Know the claustrophobic brush of reality, always indirect, always through this world-sheet. Now close your eyes and feel how these perturbations disappear. Ask: where does it all go? What happens to those wind-whips on the surface of our ponds? Are they simply gone as soon as we avert our gaze?</p>
<p class="p1">Maybe, I decide, if we’re lucky. Maybe sometimes, and sometimes not.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Sometimes it’s a mirror.</p>
<p class="p1">Sometimes it’s a pane of glass.</p>
<p class="p1">And sometimes, it’s an open door.</p>
</section>
<section>
<p class="p1">When I told Dr. Zhang that I wanted to meet in a public place, this isn’t exactly what I had in mind. There are, it transpires, two New Prosperity Shopping Centers near Fudan University. The newer one lies just northwest of campus, and looks from a distance like a bathtub. Arriving early, I cased the outside, watching bubbles cascading ivy-like down the translucent walls, half-expecting an enormous dangling arm. I spent five cheerful minutes with a grass-jelly tea in a bustling central cafeteria, before I realized that this is not the place.</p>
<p class="p1">The <i>old </i>New Prosperity is further west, over in Fengzhen Ward. In its photos I can just make out Min’s Miscellaneous Electronics, which Dr. Zhang mentioned as a meeting point. I guess I can’t blame the guy. He looks about a million years old in his Fudan headshot, and in his heyday it might have been the spot. But — <i>fuck</i>. With ten minutes to spare, I hustle against the remaining daylight, brushing upstream through soccer teams, passing dorms big enough for an entire YINS undergraduate class. Fengzhen’s wardgates are in a dim concrete checkpoint beneath an overpass. I tap; the card reader grinds, samples my ward-trail, and buzzes unhappily.</p>
<p class="p1 mono centered">DENIED (0x1E) PATH LENGTH EXCEEDED — SEE ATTENDANT</p>
<p class="p1">There’s no attendant. The booth is empty; the wardboard screens are shattered. My app for this tells me that Fengzhen and Xietu South are in a standoff over some Ward Council edict, caught in a hairball of wards refusing their tokens to each others’ residents. So if I want some FZN, I can trade for it on the open market. Or...</p>
<p class="p1">Three figures in billowing black tentcloaks appear at speed, faces painted: delicate black lines on a stark white field. Without slowing down, they each pick a gate. Taking the card reader as a suggestion — no, wait, as a foothold — they grab the plexiglass gates’ top edges and sail over in silent unison. <i>If they look like Chalkers, they’re probably not. </i>This is my rule, and that, just now, looked like cosplay. Only there was something entirely too uniform about their motion. It was so quiet, so fluid, that it was barely a disturbance; I almost missed it, hunched over my wanji.</p>
<p class="p1">With no experience and no gecko gloves, the climb takes me longer. Awkwardly straddling the top, I consider what might happen if I were spotted; downtown is one thing, but if you’re sneaking into a mid-ring residential ward, you’d better have friends there. But the blind-eye winks encouragingly from the cameras above: <i>go on, do your thing. I’m not really watching</i>. I land, all wrong, in Fengzhen Ward. Pretty sure no one saw me come through.</p>
<p class="p1">Five past the hour. The towers are squat, peeling, off-white, redeemed by balconies overflowing with laundry and starlinks and greenery. The magnolias, half-blighted but too precious to spare, are ringed with cytogenic spray-foam, sprouting synthetic limbs. Dusk falls behind dense power-line thickets. Quiet, overly so, save for the last of the cicadas and my own breath, my own footfall.</p>
<p class="p1">Quarter past. Old New Prosperity Shopping Center is a simple structure, a three-story concrete maze of indoor stalls ringing a square courtyard. Pigeons hoard daylight atop the dusty, angular skylights, and chickens strut around in old skincare boutiques. Fenced sneakers line the walls of a former moped showroom. The public safety checkpoint is a converted cell kiosk. The word that comes to mind is <i>carapace</i>. But an inflatable, visor-wearing pig still advertises a children’s tiyan-guan, and the laoban of a cerulean-tiled fishmart gives me a look like <i>I will defend you with this broom. </i>No one else is around. So I order some fish balls (why wait hungry?) and eat them with the slow, dignified air of someone named Dr. Zhang Peifeng. I’m fifteen minutes late, but I’m meeting an old-time academic. Those are rookie numbers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Thirty minutes. Sixty. He never comes. I listen as the grates go down, counting on one hand the stars in my rectangle of washed-out sky. A passing raincloud sends me under an arcade of rounded concrete. Figures lope by, weary with the day’s business, a world away from the Fudan Applied Neikotics department. And when the only light I can see is from the mottled red-and-white sign of Min’s Miscellaneous Electronics, I begin to worry. And only then do I pay the place any attention, look past the LED tickers all advertising themselves, and notice what else is in the window. Arranged in profile on white wire shelves, prices dangling from bright paper tags, are cameras.</p>

<p class="p1">The door chimes Infrasong as I step inside, sending my spine tingling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s dim halogen, floor to ceiling pegboard shelving, and maybe <i>miscellaneous</i> is an understatement. Blenders and water heaters are stocked between factory-reject TPU arrays and stadium-grade quasigram projectors. A row of plastic tubs brims with voxelite pilfered from the city’s trading floors, three eggs for twenty ping. But a familiar iridescence draws my eye, and then my feet, to the glass display case in the back.</p>
<p class="p2">The shopkeeper reserved all their care for these smoothly metallic teardrops, two dozen total, each in its own foam-lined case. I never noticed from ground level how much they vary in shape. But they’re all the size of a hand fruit, with the same basic structure. The tapered side has an inlet for CAT-5. The bulbous end hides the lens behind mirrored coating. It’s stamped with the blind-eye that has become synonymous with Shanghai.</p>
<p class="p1">“Get a load of the serial numbers.” A quiet voice startles me, emerging from the back through thick plastic drapes. The laoban is a woman just past the crest of middle age, with a sharp chin, weathered features, a pleasant crinkle around the eye. Her hair is buzzed perfunctorily short. “Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-five-seven-nine,” she reads fondly off the leftmost Mirror Sea camera. She speaks so softly that I have to lean in to make this out. “This is a prototype from the the Century Park pilot. But, count the digits — they had ambitions.”</p>
<p class="p1">This woman is Zhang Peifeng, I realize. Or rather she has his N-1 license, and used it to log into the Soup and contact Deng. The cameras, the weird and stilted messages to an old colleague, it all adds up to something like this. I consider how to come clean. And then — despite my purpose here, despite everything, I ask: “Can I hold it?”</p>
<p class="p1">I expect her to laugh me off, but she nods solemnly and fetches a pair of microfiber gloves for each of us. “They had a real problem with fingerprints at first. The hash is sensitive to patterns like that — careful, <i>careful</i>,” she mutters, placing it into my hands. It has real heft, maybe double what I expected. “Here, take the front and give it a twist.”</p>
<p class="p1">I do, gingerly, feeling three tiny clicks and a satisfying counterclockwise whir. Then, from a seam unseen, the hemispherical cap falls into my hand. There’s a milky-quartz dragonfly eye behind it, or that’s how it looks, hundreds of nearly opaque facets that let light play through them only along intricate, rainbow-flecked micrometer grooves. An optical implementation of the Lam-Waldmann hash, carved by laser into real quartz. For the architects of the Mirror Sea, there could be no second-guessing the anonymizing properties of their surveillance system. A conventional lens, with the hash running in software behind it, would never win the public’s trust.</p>
<p class="p1">She hesitates now, leaning around me to peer out at the deserted, unlit courtyard. From a locked box beneath the cabinet, she produces a truly ancient CRT monitor no wider than my hand. She looks me over, once, twice, and then asks, “would you like to see?”</p>
<p class="p1">What the Weather Bureau did left me with a reflexive <i>no</i> to this question. But I didn’t come here to look away. I nod, and she peeks up, out the window, back at me. Satisfied, she digs for a power cable. It occurs to me that since entering Fengzhen Ward I haven’t seen a single Mirror Sea display. Not on the walls, not embedded in the sidewalks, not even on a cheap TV by a sushi-counter fish tank. Something half-dawns on me. <i>But if she thinks it’</i>s <i>safe</i>...</p>
<p class="p1">She clips a CAT-5 cable into the camera and it beeps once. “Now look.”</p>
<p class="p1">I gasp softly when I see what appears onscreen. It has depth, this jagged and concentric formation. It reflects faint hints of Min’s Miscellaneous in the color, texture, and geometry of its facets. I would say it’s kaleidoscopic, but there’s a way in which it’s precisely not: while a kaleidoscope is sensitive to tiny movements, the Lam-Waldmann Hash of the store’s interior barely changes as I swing the camera around. I point the lens at the shopkeeper; she raises an eyebrow, but appears only as a dark bloom on the peaks of larger waves. After a while she gestures for the camera back.</p>
<p class="p1">“I’ll part with it for forty thousand ping.” She smiles at my nervous laughter. “But not lightly, and not for a stranger. It serves me better as a conversation piece, anyway. So what can I really do for you?”</p>
<p class="p1">“I’m looking for Dr. Zhang Peifeng.” I steady myself. I make it a statement and not a question, and scan her politely bemused eyes for recognition. “I — he — we talked on the —”</p>
<p class="p1">The door crashes open. She saw it happening, but too late, one hand stowing the monitor and the other reaching fruitlessly for a remote to lock the door. Two tall, black-clad figures stride down the center aisle in perfect unison, and I have the horrible sense that something alien watches us through the fixed parallax of their four beady eyes. <i>But that’s the wrong number of eyes.</i> A three-by-three diamond formation of stylized eyes is painted — no, tattooed — onto their chalk-white foreheads. They blink in the strangest sort of way: I can pry them open one by one with my attention, but they snap closed the moment I look away. I know who these people are; I just never believed they existed.</p>
<p class="p1">The Chalkers aren’t a monolith. Their disagreements play out on the walls, just under our noses. Their affiliations are — not to put too fine a point on it — as ephemeral and illegible as anything you’d find in the Mirror Sea. But there are old ways to be remembered. Beliefs, root-level and bone-dry, to be held in a deeply parabolic stillness and silence. And the Nine-Eyes keep them, in their triple-point redoubts, studded with Mirror Sea cameras but utterly devoid of Mirror Sea displays. <i>Because —</i> the thought prickles my from neck into my shoulders — <i>because they don’t need them, any more than a fish needs a snorkel. </i>No, that’s not quite right. <i>Any more than the ocean needs a snorkel.</i></p>
<p class="p1">“You looked,” one of them intones. The way his voice cracks, almost squeaks, from extended disuse: it would be funny, but it isn’t. They both speak at the same time.<i> “We just saw you looking.”</i> The words come with — no, the words <i>are</i> a tightening grasp, choking me into a tight loop of only-just-memory, of gazing into the output of that single camera. I grip the glass countertop, ripping my gaze back towards the woman, who I’ve decided must be Min. There’s fear on her face, but mixed with a gradation of annoyance and a glimmer of thrilled amusement. Most likely this has happened before.</p>
<p class="p1">“Our arrangement has been in place for a long time.” She emphasizes those last two words, as though speaking for the record, for an unseen observer. “I can’t sell just to you. The shop won’t survive. It was <i>one</i> camera —”</p>
<p class="p1"><i>“Too close. Too often.” </i>They redouble their insistence, the words growing convex. <i>“Not careful. And at night.”</i></p>
<p class="p1">With a telescoping baton, with metronomic four-four precision, one of them begins to break things. The other leans down towards Min, his forehead in her face, her eyes locked into something I can’t see. Whatever fury irradiates her, it exists at such a scale that these men amount to mere pinholes. Maybe that’s what she finds amusing. But she sighs, infuriated, as the Nine-Eye palms her antique camera. “We’re taking this. No sale.”</p>
<p class="p1">“The fuck you are,” comes a voice from the back. A voice — my head spins, drowning in the perfectly periodic crashing sounds coming from the aisles — a voice that I <i>recognize</i>. The plastic curtain parts again, and there stands Mbetethi Okeme. Tethi. Whatever. “Put it down and go.”</p>
<p class="p1">Two things: Tethi is taller than this Chalker, which counts for something, and his gaze is positively blazing with Sunflower Sieve debris. I wouldn’t call it a controlled burn, but he’s got a mental harness or two around it — I see him smile when it whips in a direction I can only describe as outwards. He clears the counter fluidly and stings the closer Nine-Eyes with a small and possibly homemade taser. The sound it makes, the <i>smell</i> it makes: it should have sent the man writhing to the floor. But he only peers back at Tethi with timid, almost pathetic surprise.</p>
<p class="p1"><i>“Go,”</i> Tethi shouts again. “You need us here. This the arrangement.” To my astonishment, they do. The stung Chalker stumbles back towards the door and his partner follows as though bungee-corded along, running his baton percussively along a shelf of rice cookers. “Expect a bill,” Tethi snarls, as the door closes — and locks — behind them. For a minute I’m not even there. He holds her defensively, panting, expelling adrenaline. In truth, he looks more shaken than Min, who is merely surveying the damage with double-precision dismay.</p>
<p class="p1">“What are you doing, pretending to be a professor?” She ducks out of his embrace, smacks the back of his head with her still-gloved hand, and scans the back for a dustpan. “You’re bringing trouble to the shop, Teth.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Auntie Min.” He addresses her as <i>Min ayi</i>, with considerable disbelief but not an ounce of disrespect. “<i>I’m</i> bringing trouble to the shop?”</p>
<p class="p1">“I watched this sweet young woman sit outside in the rain waiting for, ahem, Dr. Zhang Peifeng.” She pronounces the name musically. “I <i>saw</i> that name on one of those N-1 licenses. Why do you do this? <i>They</i> are one thing,<i> them </i>I can deal with” — she points out the door — “but it is the <i>height</i> of <i>foolishness</i> to drag a Fudan professor into your <i>schemes!</i>” She turns to me, the fury draining so quickly from her face that I have to laugh. “Are you all right, dear?”</p>
<p class="p1">Tethi finally turns his eyes to me. I see that a lot has accumulated there since we last met: a surplus of neikotic debris, for one, and a deficit of sleep. But a small, weary smile appears symmetrically on our faces. Because, surely, each of us are dead certain the other is thinking the same thing: <i>Son of a bitch, I should have known!</i></p>

There are, it transpires, two New Prosperity Shopping Centers near Fudan University. The newer one lies just northwest of campus, and looks from a distance like a bathtub. Arriving early, I cased the outside, watching bubbles cascading ivy-like down the translucent walls, half-expecting an enormous dangling arm. I spent five cheerful minutes with a grass-jelly tea in a bustling central cafeteria, before I realized that this is not the place.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eThe \u003ci\u003eold \u003c/i\u003eNew Prosperity is further west, over in Fengzhen Ward. In its photos I can just make out Min’s Miscellaneous Electronics, which Dr. Zhang mentioned as a meeting point. I guess I can’t blame the guy. He looks about a million years old in his Fudan headshot, and in his heyday it might have been the spot. But — \u003ci\u003efuck\u003c/i\u003e. With ten minutes to spare, I hustle against the remaining daylight, brushing upstream through soccer teams, passing dorms big enough for an entire YINS undergraduate class. Fengzhen’s wardgates are in a dim concrete checkpoint beneath an overpass. I tap; the card reader grinds, samples my ward-trail, and buzzes unhappily.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1 mono centered\\\"\u003eDENIED (0x1E) PATH LENGTH EXCEEDED — SEE ATTENDANT\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eThere’s no attendant. The booth is empty; the wardboard screens are shattered. My app for this tells me that Fengzhen and Xietu South are in a standoff over some Ward Council edict, caught in a hairball of wards refusing their tokens to each others’ residents. So if I want some FZN, I can trade for it on the open market. Or...\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eThree figures in billowing black tentcloaks appear at speed, faces painted: delicate black lines on a stark white field. Without slowing down, they each pick a gate. Taking the card reader as a suggestion — no, wait, as a foothold — they grab the plexiglass gates’ top edges and sail over in silent unison. \u003ci\u003eIf they look like Chalkers, they’re probably not. \u003c/i\u003eThis is my rule, and that, just now, looked like cosplay. Only there was something entirely too uniform about their motion. It was so quiet, so fluid, that it was barely a disturbance; I almost missed it, hunched over my wanji.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eWith no experience and no gecko gloves, the climb takes me longer. Awkwardly straddling the top, I consider what might happen if I were spotted; downtown is one thing, but if you’re sneaking into a mid-ring residential ward, you’d better have friends there. But the blind-eye winks encouragingly from the cameras above: \u003ci\u003ego on, do your thing. I’m not really watching\u003c/i\u003e. I land, all wrong, in Fengzhen Ward. Pretty sure no one saw me come through.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eFive past the hour. The towers are squat, peeling, off-white, redeemed by balconies overflowing with laundry and starlinks and greenery. The magnolias, half-blighted but too precious to spare, are ringed with cytogenic spray-foam, sprouting synthetic limbs. Dusk falls behind dense power-line thickets. Quiet, overly so, save for the last of the cicadas and my own breath, my own footfall.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eQuarter past. Old New Prosperity Shopping Center is a simple structure, a three-story concrete maze of indoor stalls ringing a square courtyard. Pigeons hoard daylight atop the dusty, angular skylights, and chickens strut around in old skincare boutiques. Fenced sneakers line the walls of a former moped showroom. The public safety checkpoint is a converted cell kiosk. The word that comes to mind is \u003ci\u003ecarapace\u003c/i\u003e. But an inflatable, visor-wearing pig still advertises a children’s tiyan-guan, and the laoban of a cerulean-tiled fishmart gives me a look like \u003ci\u003eI will defend you with this broom. \u003c/i\u003eNo one else is around. So I order some fish balls (why wait hungry?) and eat them with the slow, dignified air of someone named Dr. Zhang Peifeng. I’m fifteen minutes late, but I’m meeting an old-time academic. Those are rookie numbers.\u003cspan class=\\\"Apple-converted-space\\\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eThirty minutes. Sixty. He never comes. I listen as the grates go down, counting on one hand the stars in my rectangle of washed-out sky. A passing raincloud sends me under an arcade of rounded concrete. Figures lope by, weary with the day’s business, a world away from the Fudan Applied Neikotics department. And when the only light I can see is from the mottled red-and-white sign of Min’s Miscellaneous Electronics, I begin to worry. And only then do I pay the place any attention, look past the LED tickers all advertising themselves, and notice what else is in the window. Arranged in profile on white wire shelves, prices dangling from bright paper tags, are cameras.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/section\u003e\\n\u003csection\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eThe door chimes Infrasong as I step inside, sending my spine tingling.\u003cspan class=\\\"Apple-converted-space\\\"\u003e  \u003c/span\u003eIt’s dim halogen, floor to ceiling pegboard shelving, and maybe \u003ci\u003emiscellaneous\u003c/i\u003e is an understatement. Blenders and water heaters are stocked between factory-reject TPU arrays and stadium-grade quasigram projectors. A row of plastic tubs brims with voxelite pilfered from the city’s trading floors, three eggs for twenty ping. But a familiar iridescence draws my eye, and then my feet, to the glass display case in the back.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p2\\\"\u003eThe shopkeeper reserved all their care for these smoothly metallic teardrops, two dozen total, each in its own foam-lined case. I never noticed from ground level how much they vary in shape. But they’re all the size of a hand fruit, with the same basic structure. The tapered side has an inlet for CAT-5. The bulbous end hides the lens behind mirrored coating. It’s stamped with the blind-eye that has become synonymous with Shanghai.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“Get a load of the serial numbers.” A quiet voice startles me, emerging from the back through thick plastic drapes. The laoban is a woman just past the crest of middle age, with a sharp chin, weathered features, a pleasant crinkle around the eye. Her hair is buzzed perfunctorily short. “Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-five-seven-nine,” she reads fondly off the leftmost Mirror Sea camera. She speaks so softly that I have to lean in to make this out. “This is a prototype from the the Century Park pilot. But, count the digits — they had ambitions.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eThis woman is Zhang Peifeng, I realize. Or rather she has his N-1 license, and used it to log into the Soup and contact Deng. The cameras, the weird and stilted messages to an old colleague, it all adds up to something like this. I consider how to come clean. And then — despite my purpose here, despite everything, I ask: “Can I hold it?”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eI expect her to laugh me off, but she nods solemnly and fetches a pair of microfiber gloves for each of us. “They had a real problem with fingerprints at first. The hash is sensitive to patterns like that — careful, \u003ci\u003ecareful\u003c/i\u003e,” she mutters, placing it into my hands. It has real heft, maybe double what I expected. “Here, take the front and give it a twist.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eI do, gingerly, feeling three tiny clicks and a satisfying counterclockwise whir. Then, from a seam unseen, the hemispherical cap falls into my hand. There’s a milky-quartz dragonfly eye behind it, or that’s how it looks, hundreds of nearly opaque facets that let light play through them only along intricate, rainbow-flecked micrometer grooves. An optical implementation of the Lam-Waldmann hash, carved by laser into real quartz. For the architects of the Mirror Sea, there could be no second-guessing the anonymizing properties of their surveillance system. A conventional lens, with the hash running in software behind it, would never win the public’s trust.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eShe hesitates now, leaning around me to peer out at the deserted, unlit courtyard. From a locked box beneath the cabinet, she produces a truly ancient CRT monitor no wider than my hand. She looks me over, once, twice, and then asks, “would you like to see?”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eWhat the Weather Bureau did left me with a reflexive \u003ci\u003eno\u003c/i\u003e to this question. But I didn’t come here to look away. I nod, and she peeks up, out the window, back at me. Satisfied, she digs for a power cable. It occurs to me that since entering Fengzhen Ward I haven’t seen a single Mirror Sea display. Not on the walls, not embedded in the sidewalks, not even on a cheap TV by a sushi-counter fish tank. Something half-dawns on me. \u003ci\u003eBut if she thinks it’\u003c/i\u003es \u003ci\u003esafe\u003c/i\u003e...\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eShe clips a CAT-5 cable into the camera and it beeps once. “Now look.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eI gasp softly when I see what appears onscreen. It has depth, this jagged and concentric formation. It reflects faint hints of Min’s Miscellaneous in the color, texture, and geometry of its facets. I would say it’s kaleidoscopic, but there’s a way in which it’s precisely not: while a kaleidoscope is sensitive to tiny movements, the Lam-Waldmann Hash of the store’s interior barely changes as I swing the camera around. I point the lens at the shopkeeper; she raises an eyebrow, but appears only as a dark bloom on the peaks of larger waves. After a while she gestures for the camera back.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“I’ll part with it for forty thousand ping.” She smiles at my nervous laughter. “But not lightly, and not for a stranger. It serves me better as a conversation piece, anyway. So what can I really do for you?”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“I’m looking for Dr. Zhang Peifeng.” I steady myself. I make it a statement and not a question, and scan her politely bemused eyes for recognition. “I — he — we talked on the —”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eThe door crashes open. She saw it happening, but too late, one hand stowing the monitor and the other reaching fruitlessly for a remote to lock the door. Two tall, black-clad figures stride down the center aisle in perfect unison, and I have the horrible sense that something alien watches us through the fixed parallax of their four beady eyes. \u003ci\u003eBut that’s the wrong number of eyes.\u003c/i\u003e A three-by-three diamond formation of stylized eyes is painted — no, tattooed — onto their chalk-white foreheads. They blink in the strangest sort of way: I can pry them open one by one with my attention, but they snap closed the moment I look away. I know who these people are; I just never believed they existed.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eThe Chalkers aren’t a monolith. Their disagreements play out on the walls, just under our noses. Their affiliations are — not to put too fine a point on it — as ephemeral and illegible as anything you’d find in the Mirror Sea. But there are old ways to be remembered. Beliefs, root-level and bone-dry, to be held in a deeply parabolic stillness and silence. And the Nine-Eyes keep them, in their triple-point redoubts, studded with Mirror Sea cameras but utterly devoid of Mirror Sea displays. \u003ci\u003eBecause —\u003c/i\u003e the thought prickles my from neck into my shoulders — \u003ci\u003ebecause they don’t need them, any more than a fish needs a snorkel. \u003c/i\u003eNo, that’s not quite right. \u003ci\u003eAny more than the ocean needs a snorkel.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“You looked,” one of them intones. The way his voice cracks, almost squeaks, from extended disuse: it would be funny, but it isn’t. They both speak at the same time.\u003ci\u003e “We just saw you looking.”\u003c/i\u003e The words come with — no, the words \u003ci\u003eare\u003c/i\u003e a tightening grasp, choking me into a tight loop of only-just-memory, of gazing into the output of that single camera. I grip the glass countertop, ripping my gaze back towards the woman, who I’ve decided must be Min. There’s fear on her face, but mixed with a gradation of annoyance and a glimmer of thrilled amusement. Most likely this has happened before.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“Our arrangement has been in place for a long time.” She emphasizes those last two words, as though speaking for the record, for an unseen observer. “I can’t sell just to you. The shop won’t survive. It was \u003ci\u003eone\u003c/i\u003e camera —”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e“Too close. Too often.” \u003c/i\u003eThey redouble their insistence, the words growing convex. \u003ci\u003e“Not careful. And at night.”\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eWith a telescoping baton, with metronomic four-four precision, one of them begins to break things. The other leans down towards Min, his forehead in her face, her eyes locked into something I can’t see. Whatever fury irradiates her, it exists at such a scale that these men amount to mere pinholes. Maybe that’s what she finds amusing. But she sighs, infuriated, as the Nine-Eye palms her antique camera. “We’re taking this. No sale.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“The fuck you are,” comes a voice from the back. A voice — my head spins, drowning in the perfectly periodic crashing sounds coming from the aisles — a voice that I \u003ci\u003erecognize\u003c/i\u003e. The plastic curtain parts again, and there stands Mbetethi Okeme. Tethi. Whatever. “Put it down and go.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eTwo things: Tethi is taller than this Chalker, which counts for something, and his gaze is positively blazing with Sunflower Sieve debris. I wouldn’t call it a controlled burn, but he’s got a mental harness or two around it — I see him smile when it whips in a direction I can only describe as outwards. He clears the counter fluidly and stings the closer Nine-Eyes with a small and possibly homemade taser. The sound it makes, the \u003ci\u003esmell\u003c/i\u003e it makes: it should have sent the man writhing to the floor. But he only peers back at Tethi with timid, almost pathetic surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e“Go,”\u003c/i\u003e Tethi shouts again. “You need us here. This the arrangement.” To my astonishment, they do. The stung Chalker stumbles back towards the door and his partner follows as though bungee-corded along, running his baton percussively along a shelf of rice cookers. “Expect a bill,” Tethi snarls, as the door closes — and locks — behind them. For a minute I’m not even there. He holds her defensively, panting, expelling adrenaline. In truth, he looks more shaken than Min, who is merely surveying the damage with double-precision dismay.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“What are you doing, pretending to be a professor?” She ducks out of his embrace, smacks the back of his head with her still-gloved hand, and scans the back for a dustpan. “You’re bringing trouble to the shop, Teth.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“Auntie Min.” He addresses her as \u003ci\u003eMin ayi\u003c/i\u003e, with considerable disbelief but not an ounce of disrespect. “\u003ci\u003eI’m\u003c/i\u003e bringing trouble to the shop?”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“I watched this sweet young woman sit outside in the rain waiting for, ahem, Dr. Zhang Peifeng.” She pronounces the name musically. “I \u003ci\u003esaw\u003c/i\u003e that name on one of those N-1 licenses.
