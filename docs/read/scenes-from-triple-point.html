<p class="p1">Tethi talks about the Chalk in terms of tides. I already knew about the way it pulls people in — I’d heard less about the symmetrical way it pushes people out, sometimes just as violently, sometimes after taking years. I have to take him at his word that the triple points are the shallows: where you go in, where you come out. He says the locals from adjacent wards even come to their night market. You tend to imagine Chalkers living hand-to-mouth on stolen mangoes and penicillin. But you also hear of hospitals and riverbed submarines. Stories of the eerie effortlessness with which they feed and clothe the all-comers who fall through the cracks beneath the cracks. That takes money, which takes hustlers slumming it at the event horizon, like Tethi and Min.</p>
<p class="p1">I find Triple Point even spookier in the daytime: the black tarps everywhere, the stale and humid air, the last of the cicadas. For all the abandoned businesses, there is motion on the fringes of everything. Chalkers have ways of being seen only in the periphery, in vague generalities, after the fact. Sometimes I’ll get inside Old New Prosperity before an accumulation of sights and sounds and smells crashes over me: the street had been bustling, practically thronged, with people. I try to stitch these impressions along their usual edges, to recall who or what I had seen out there. But they fit together in a different way than usual. They fit together along grooves made of coincidence and repetition and correlation and —</p>
<p class="p1">The chime of Min’s door dispels this dark, warm, and wavy undercurrent, and brings me back into frame. I already can’t remember it, and surely<i> that</i> should at least be familiar? But no: loop-lock memories are gaseous and diffuse, trappable in tiny pockets. This is liquid, heavy, swirling down the drain. It was not a visual or audible sensation. It was certainly not a smell. But for a moment it took everything I had to give.</p>
<p class="p1">“Your <i>face!</i>” Tethi is laughing, but as though to draw me into the joke, to make it funny instead of scary. “Don’t let it build up like that. And anyway, it won’t last long indoors.” Lips pursed, clearly reluctant to lay bare any mechanics: “Out of view of the cameras.”</p>
<p class="p1">Indeed, the only Chalkers I ever really encounter are the ones who come into Min’s shop. Their errands bring them careening in with purposes they can no longer name or articulate. She makes them dry off in a little nook, where scalding tea and sweet cakes help snap them into their own senses. Then she primly reminds them that she sells cable and cameras, <i>sell</i> being the operative word. Others don’t cooperate: they burst in and stride up to the counter in perfect unison and demand things in a language not even Tethi can understand. They give off the horrible sense that, behind their onyx-dark Contecs, something alien watches us through their parallax. One of two things will happen here: Tethi will jump the counter, brandish a buzz baton, insist they leave. Or Min will invite them to stay.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s only when she offers me a bunk of my own that I realize just how many people are staying in the back of the store. Most are on their way out of the Chalk: I can tell by the convalescent half-glaze of their gazes, the introductions that mix up <i>I </i>and <i>you.</i> But some are on their way way in. There are the runners-from, fleeing raw losses or deep debts and seeking only obliteration. Then there are the runners-to, jaundiced with screen-lust, feverish with desire for the real Sea, marshaling the courage to take those last few steps. They linger, for a night, or a week or — I’m beginning to piece Tethi’s story together, despite his best efforts — in one case a year, becoming useful, never quite getting around to leaving. Min offers what she can to all of them without judgement. And it doesn’t appear to strike her as strange in the least, when I show up again and again, at gradually odder hours, always with bags of goods pilfered from the YINS Neikotic Engineering floors.</p>
</section>
<section>
<p class="p1">I like Min. She never says much, but I like the incense she burns, the feverish way she dusts, the cable bouquets she makes out of some compulsion. I like watching her and Tethi exchange their quiet affection. But I wonder about her.</p>
<p class="p1">One night she turns to me and raises an eyebrow. “Watch the counter?”</p>
<p class="p1">She pulls on a coat and leaves. When, exactly, did <i>this</i> happen? Maybe it was last night, when she pulled us out of Tethi’s room, away from our little assembly line, and served us heaping portions of fish soaked with lemon and ginger. Maybe it was the day before that, when I helped them gut a busted trash collector to extract one pricey little coil. Or the day before that, when Min and Tethi together listed twelve songs containing the word <i>California</i> — in English, Mando, and Korean all three, as my face went darker and darker red. It has been…exactly how many days?</p>
<p class="p1">All I know is I don’t mind it here. It’s quiet in a way that YINS can never manage, its walls always humming with current and coolant. The Chalkers largely hold the Sea in their hearts, in deep wells of quadratic belief, and there are relatively few Mirror Sea displays around Triple Point. The lack of jump scares on those screens is relief I didn’t know I needed. The work we’re doing is grueling, yeah. My fingers are burnt with hot plastic and solder and the shock of stray couplings. Tethi is a maestro; there are layers and layers to even simple neikotic devices that I will never again take for granted. He would do well at YINS — no, he <i>will</i> do well. Only he may have to convince me to go back with him.</p>
<p class="p1">But I can’t stay forever, and the reminder comes in the form of three Chalkers who burst through the door, late past sundown. That tends to mean trouble, and I grip the worn yellow handle of the buzz baton under the counter, completely unsure if I’m capable of using it. They stride up to the counter in their face paint and rags and —</p>
<p class="p1">“Did you fix it?” The smallest of them shouts past my shoulder to Tethi.</p>
<p class="p1">And with that, a certain illusion dissipates. These are young teenagers, barely past the age where the Weather Bureau stops trying to snatch you back out of the Chalk, reasoning that you’re old enough to make your choice.</p>
<p class="p1">“I thought you guys weren’t coming back,” Tethi tells them, overly morose. “I traded it for a pallet of teleromase smoothies.”</p>
<p class="p1">“We said we were coming back,” says the small one. As he dries off I clock that his Mandarin comes with a thick North Korean accent.</p>
<p class="p1">“We got caught up moving a choir-bubble south-ways,” insists the tall one. She sounds Nigerian, reed-skinny but already taller than Tethi. “Tough wards. Hard to know where you’re going once you’re in it. You know how it is.”</p>
<p class="p1">“You <i>know</i> how it is,” agrees the small one.</p>
<p class="p1">Tethi blinks once and then breaks into a shit-eating grin. “I am just fucking with you guys. Of course I fixed it.” He leads them to the second storeroom and pulls a clamshell case off a high shelf with a grunt. “Refilled the fog, too.”</p>
<p class="p1">I lean in the doorframe, highly amused, as pulls a children’s quasigram projector, a rubbery green spherical thing, from its foam lining. <i>“OUR SOLAR SYSTEM,” </i>booms the speaker, when he flicks the switch.</p>
<p class="p1">“I’ve <i>seen</i> this one,” the small one complains. He flips through some presets:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“<i>THE MILKY WAY GALAXY —”</i></p>
<p class="p1"><i>“THE AMAZON RAINFOREST —”</i></p>
<p class="p1"><i>“THE GOBI DESERT —”</i></p>
<p class="p1"><i>“THE PACIFIC REEF BUILDERS —”</i></p>
<p class="p1"><i>“THE MIRROR SEA OF SHANGHAI —”</i></p>
<p class="p1">“You guys,” Tethi insists. “Why don’t you watch something else for once.”</p>
<p class="p1">So two of them try slingshotting probes around the sun. The third one — well, I can’t precisely pin him down. That particular Chalker here-nor-thereness hasn’t worn off since he stepped out of the cameras, and he says nothing, reacts to little. Soon Tethi pulls him aside, down the hall, into his own room. He shoots me a look, and then another one, and only then do I understand he means me to follow. When the young Chalker is seated in his office chair, he asks, “you didn’t come for the projector, did you?”</p>
<p class="p1">The Chalker boy tries to speak and produces only round little whispers. Tethi offers him various little stimulations: a piece of chocolate, a stress ball, and eventually, reluctantly, a bright white LED to the eyes. “Are you in there?”</p>
<p class="p1">“They won’t come out,” he finally replies, low and hoarse. “Even when I’m days off the street. There’s something inside me, something flashy, something they’re too attracted to. I invite them to go, I tip out, and they only cling tighter.”</p>
<p class="p1">Sudden flashes now of loop-locked memory. “Does it feel reflective?” I ask. I’m uncertain if I should — what if that makes it somehow more salient, more real? And a chill runs down my spine, in my fingertips, when he nods.</p>
<p class="p1">Tethi drapes a readonly net over the boy’s head and mutters all sorts of reassuring things. I can totally picture him working the clinic. Now he swivels the display away so he and I can see the manifolds onscreen. And I don’t totally trust what I see there. I’ve spent so much time with it that I see those clawing spirals always in my peripheral vision. But it’s hard to argue that, fuzzy and weak though it is, the kid’s ‘folds are full of Sunflower Sieve debris.</p>
<p class="p1">“Is he a neikonaut?” I whisper.</p>
<p class="p1">“No way,” Tethi replies, panning, zooming, peering at more readouts.</p>
<p class="p1">“Then the inversion won’t take, right?”</p>
<p class="p1">“That’s supposed to be your thing,” he hisses. “But we can’t use my rig. Chalkers cannot keep secrets. If <i>any</i> of them find out what I’m doing down there, they’ll all know soon. I will be toast.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Do you see them in there?” The Chalker boy asks.</p>
<p class="p1">“Yes. I do.” Tethi steadies his voice with false cheer. It’s not an outright lie — more like, it’s impossible to tell if any of these dripping, liquid manifolds could possibly originate with a Ripple. “You should stay here for a few days until they clear out. Min can find you a bunk.” But an hour passes in which we try to pretend all is well. We offer them packs of energy bars, and he leaves with his friends, casting apologetically back to Tethi as the door chimes shut.</p>
<p class="p1">“What does this mean?” We share a long, grim look. I find myself missing Yao.</p>
<p class="p1">“It means we’re going to need more headsets.”</p>
</section>
<section>
<p class="p1">I stay very late that night. The hours run together, the way things at Triple Point tend to do. I’m still soldering well past midnight. My tongue is between my teeth, my hand steady, running liquid metal over tiny pins.</p>
<p class="p1">“You’re going to need a CV,” I say too loudly, too suddenly. “For YINS.”</p>
<p class="p1">Tethi nods approvingly at my soldering work. Hands me the next board in exchange. “What?” He processes this a moment later. “Oh, very true. Thanks.”</p>
<p class="p1">“You’re going to need to account for the years,” I go on, head in the fumes again. “You say you’re not a Chalker. Fine. I believe you. But just how much time have you spent in there?”</p>
<p class="p1">He flicks a switch and the visor-screen in his hands goes dark. He turns the music down, hears Min puttering around just outside, and then turns it up even louder. “I don’t like talking about it.”</p>
<p class="p1">“I understand.”</p>
<p class="p1">“I <i>can’t</i> talk about it. It is categorically and precisely not possible to talk about.”</p>
<p class="p1">“If this is going to work, I need more than that.”</p>
<p class="p1">He knows I’m right. He scoots his chair, cracks his knuckles. “I told you why I came to Shanghai?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah,” I reply softy. I mean, only kind of. Only in broad strokes, through tears. His father was one of the architects of the Gabonese Fork, and Tethi fled for his life. The details fill themselves in, and they aren’t pretty.</p>
<p class="p1">“I wanted to train as a neikonaut. And I was stupid enough to think that Suowei owed me something. That they’d have a clue in the world who I was. None of that worked out.” He holds up a freshly assembled headset now. “This. There’s a reason this came to mind. <i>This</i> was the work I was able to find, selling rave gizmos outside clubs and parties. People would fuck with you. Mostly they were harmless, but out there you’re always on someone else’s turf. One night, I stepped on the wrong toes. They took my pushcart and left me in a very bad state. Left me to die.”</p>
<p class="p1">I stow the soldering iron.</p>
<p class="p1">“The thing is,” Tethi goes on, “I had no home ward. And when you have no ward alignment — you know which hospitals are going to treat you? Without a fuss, without getting the bluelights involved? Chalker hospitals. They peeled me off the ground. I recovered, and then made myself useful. I...<i>god. </i>I wish I could put it into words, I really do. Five floors and a thousand eyes. The way the wind blew through the whole building at once, how that felt...” He falls silent, looking happy about something distant. It makes me glad to see him like this. “People like to say the Chalk steals people, so as not to admit that their friend or their kin made the choice. You always make the choice.”</p>
<p class="p1">I press. “And you make the choice to leave?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Well, Min took me in.” He pauses. This percolates. “Listen, I get it. If I found a mind-spanning megastructure with a twin in the Mirror Sea...” Tethi waves his arms expansively. “If I saw the Ripples were building something, I wouldn’t go to YINS for answers. I’d go to a Chalker.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Teth...”</p>
<p class="p1">“<i>But I am choosing to leave this place.</i>” He enunciates every syllable, sliding it under the music. “I need YINS to take me seriously, and that starts with you. Can you do that?”</p>
<p class="p1">Can <i>Deng</i> do that? I’ve batted this question back and forth every night, trying to sleep. In some of my little hypnagogic puppet shows, she welcomes Tethi with open arms. <i>At last,</i> she implies, <i>a student worthy of my brilliance</i>. Other times, I’m the cat and he’s what I dragged in. Mostly I turn that patch over and over in my hands, and I sit with the fact that there’s something I’m missing.</p>
<p class="p1">“Mona? Can you?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Yes. Yes. Of course I can.”</p>

<section>
<p class="p1">It’s earnestly chilly when I finally head out just a few hours before dawn. I pull my jacket on, turn my collar up against the wind that makes its way up the block. It plays the tarps and tents of Triple Point, heavy flapping and low whistles. <i>There’s something going on in there.</i> The thought is harmlessly vague against the logistics of getting home. <i>There are people going in there.</i> Lone men, whole families, with their pushcarts and shopping bags. My blood runs dense and hot, watching them turn that gentle bend into the heart of Triple Point. Tethi did mention something about a night market.</p>
<p class="p1">The Chalkers have what people need: vegetables and painkillers and brake pads. They have what people want, too: hot youtiao and lily-waft perfumes and little cartridges with three hundred hits of 4-AcO-MET. But much of what they have is not so easy to judge as vitamin or vice, necessity or nicety. You won’t know in the moment, or for many months, why it drew your eye, why it was pressed into your hand. Your money is no good in there; you just need to be brave enough to step inside. I scan the faces that pass me, inscrutable in the dark. I wonder how many are looking for a totemic seedling of a new life, and how many just need to eat.</p>
<p class="p1">And when I’m brave enough to step inside, sensation accumulates. Hot oil and and ripe fruit and pungent betel-nut linger long past the stimulus, myelinating the walls of my mind. No chatter, no laughter, no barter. Precious little light: of tiny, scrolling, monochrome displays, of blue-gas burners, of waxing moonglint on waxy mangoes. The lack is lucid. The mind finally free to consider rustling plastic, cool wind, the hundred different smells of shoes. No deliberation, no thinking twice. Decision, purchase, exchange, all made with loaded glance and portent gesture, objects simply taken, offered, swapped sight unseen in newspaper and twine. These thicken and blur into currents of exchange striated with desire and preference and ability and need, but whose? Just <i>whose</i>?</p>
<p class="p1">Above me, those red pinpricks, rubytears of blind eyes, the hum of the joy of uncountable new constellations, finally, a sky willing to watch back...</p>
<p class="p1">It takes on all the richness I let it. Glints spicedense and cherrydeep, abundance offered from all to all, wretched twice-salvaged toys, dice, rice, stationery, batteries, genzhe globes, a bewildering array of ferrous powders, the abstraction and extrusion of treasure, the glint of possibility and synchronicity, the bellyfelt goldmelt annealing of need and have into unfurling, expansion, pure motile force, the deep assurance that there is enough, so take, and give, and take again, don’t be so bashful of what you are, for even the stars are the raw fact of consumption, and there’s no need to look down upon the stars.</p>
<p class="p1">Above me the near-full moon, its distance lonestrange face humming and golden, its tendrils expanding over the fundamental, rich, warm, darkness of —<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">No, over this <i>street</i>, over the rustle of the ginkgos! Over the aftertastes in my mouth, over the weight in my hands! Over the sudden terror of trying to balance on two legs! And I am out the other side, turning over the intricate coincidence in my hands, the abstract way-thing, the color-flush hyperobject in this plastic shopping bag, the mingled relief and loss as I forget what I was meant to do with it, as it resolves into constituent pedestrian parts, into scissors and shave-gel and amphetamine drink-mix, and marble-sized prime-numbered voxelite buddhas, and a nearly intact conch shell, and a do-it-yourself dental kit. And a thumb drive labeled <i>Summer Vacation. </i>And six colors of felt-tip pen. And hundreds of Thai bhat in loose, jangling coins. And chamomile tea.</p>
<p class="p1">I take it all home. I can’t bring myself to throw it away.</p>

class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eTethi talks about the Chalk in terms of tides. I already knew about the way it pulls people in — I’d heard less about the symmetrical way it pushes people out, sometimes just as violently, sometimes after taking years. I have to take him at his word that the triple points are the shallows: where you go in, where you come out. He says the locals from adjacent wards even come to their night market. You tend to imagine Chalkers living hand-to-mouth on stolen mangoes and penicillin. But you also hear of hospitals and riverbed submarines. Stories of the eerie effortlessness with which they feed and clothe the all-comers who fall through the cracks beneath the cracks. That takes money, which takes hustlers slumming it at the event horizon, like Tethi and Min.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eI find Triple Point even spookier in the daytime: the black tarps everywhere, the stale and humid air, the last of the cicadas. For all the abandoned businesses, there is motion on the fringes of everything. Chalkers have ways of being seen only in the periphery, in vague generalities, after the fact. Sometimes I’ll get inside Old New Prosperity before an accumulation of sights and sounds and smells crashes over me: the street had been bustling, practically thronged, with people. I try to stitch these impressions along their usual edges, to recall who or what I had seen out there. But they fit together in a different way than usual. They fit together along grooves made of coincidence and repetition and correlation and —\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eThe chime of Min’s door dispels this dark, warm, and wavy undercurrent, and brings me back into frame. I already can’t remember it, and surely\u003ci\u003e that\u003c/i\u003e should at least be familiar? But no: loop-lock memories are gaseous and diffuse, trappable in tiny pockets. This is liquid, heavy, swirling down the drain. It was not a visual or audible sensation. It was certainly not a smell. But for a moment it took everything I had to give.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“Your \u003ci\u003eface!\u003c/i\u003e” Tethi is laughing, but as though to draw me into the joke, to make it funny instead of scary. “Don’t let it build up like that. And anyway, it won’t last long indoors.” Lips pursed, clearly reluctant to lay bare any mechanics: “Out of view of the cameras.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eIndeed, the only Chalkers I ever really encounter are the ones who come into Min’s shop. Their errands bring them careening in with purposes they can no longer name or articulate. She makes them dry off in a little nook, where scalding tea and sweet cakes help snap them into their own senses. Then she primly reminds them that she sells cable and cameras, \u003ci\u003esell\u003c/i\u003e being the operative word. Others don’t cooperate: they burst in and stride up to the counter in perfect unison and demand things in a language not even Tethi can understand. They give off the horrible sense that, behind their onyx-dark Contecs, something alien watches us through their parallax. One of two things will happen here: Tethi will jump the counter, brandish a buzz baton, insist they leave. Or Min will invite them to stay.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eIt’s only when she offers me a bunk of my own that I realize just how many people are staying in the back of the store. Most are on their way out of the Chalk: I can tell by the convalescent half-glaze of their gazes, the introductions that mix up \u003ci\u003eI \u003c/i\u003eand \u003ci\u003eyou.\u003c/i\u003e But some are on their way way in. There are the runners-from, fleeing raw losses or deep debts and seeking only obliteration. Then there are the runners-to, jaundiced with screen-lust, feverish with desire for the real Sea, marshaling the courage to take those last few steps. They linger, for a night, or a week or — I’m beginning to piece Tethi’s story together, despite his best efforts — in one case a year, becoming useful, never quite getting around to leaving. Min offers what she can to all of them without judgement. And it doesn’t appear to strike her as strange in the least, when I show up again and again, at gradually odder hours, always with bags of goods pilfered from the YINS Neikotic Engineering floors.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/section\u003e\\n\u003csection\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eI like Min. She never says much, but I like the incense she burns, the feverish way she dusts, the cable bouquets she makes out of some compulsion. I like watching her and Tethi exchange their quiet affection. But I wonder about her.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eOne night she turns to me and raises an eyebrow. “Watch the counter?”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eShe pulls on a coat and leaves. When, exactly, did \u003ci\u003ethis\u003c/i\u003e happen? Maybe it was last night, when she pulled us out of Tethi’s room, away from our little assembly line, and served us heaping portions of fish soaked with lemon and ginger. Maybe it was the day before that, when I helped them gut a busted trash collector to extract one pricey little coil. Or the day before that, when Min and Tethi together listed twelve songs containing the word \u003ci\u003eCalifornia\u003c/i\u003e — in English, Mando, and Korean all three, as my face went darker and darker red. It has been…exactly how many days?\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eAll I know is I don’t mind it here. It’s quiet in a way that YINS can never manage, its walls always humming with current and coolant. The Chalkers largely hold the Sea in their hearts, in deep wells of quadratic belief, and there are relatively few Mirror Sea displays around Triple Point. The lack of jump scares on those screens is relief I didn’t know I needed. The work we’re doing is grueling, yeah. My fingers are burnt with hot plastic and solder and the shock of stray couplings. Tethi is a maestro; there are layers and layers to even simple neikotic devices that I will never again take for granted. He would do well at YINS — no, he \u003ci\u003ewill\u003c/i\u003e do well. Only he may have to convince me to go back with him.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eBut I can’t stay forever, and the reminder comes in the form of three Chalkers who burst through the door, late past sundown. That tends to mean trouble, and I grip the worn yellow handle of the buzz baton under the counter, completely unsure if I’m capable of using it. They stride up to the counter in their face paint and rags and —\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“Did you fix it?” The smallest of them shouts past my shoulder to Tethi.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eAnd with that, a certain illusion dissipates. These are young teenagers, barely past the age where the Weather Bureau stops trying to snatch you back out of the Chalk, reasoning that you’re old enough to make your choice.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“I thought you guys weren’t coming back,” Tethi tells them, overly morose. “I traded it for a pallet of teleromase smoothies.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“We said we were coming back,” says the small one. As he dries off I clock that his Mandarin comes with a thick North Korean accent.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“We got caught up moving a choir-bubble south-ways,” insists the tall one. She sounds Nigerian, reed-skinny but already taller than Tethi. “Tough wards. Hard to know where you’re going once you’re in it. You know how it is.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“You \u003ci\u003eknow\u003c/i\u003e how it is,” agrees the small one.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eTethi blinks once and then breaks into a shit-eating grin. “I am just fucking with you guys. Of course I fixed it.” He leads them to the second storeroom and pulls a clamshell case off a high shelf with a grunt. “Refilled the fog, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eI lean in the doorframe, highly amused, as pulls a children’s quasigram projector, a rubbery green spherical thing, from its foam lining. \u003ci\u003e“OUR SOLAR SYSTEM,” \u003c/i\u003ebooms the speaker, when he flicks the switch.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“I’ve \u003ci\u003eseen\u003c/i\u003e this one,” the small one complains.

The third one — well, I can’t precisely pin him down. That particular Chalker here-nor-thereness hasn’t worn off since he stepped out of the cameras, and he says nothing, reacts to little. Soon Tethi pulls him aside, down the hall, into his own room. He shoots me a look, and then another one, and only then do I understand he means me to follow. When the young Chalker is seated in his office chair, he asks, “you didn’t come for the projector, did you?”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eThe Chalker boy tries to speak and produces only round little whispers. Tethi offers him various little stimulations: a piece of chocolate, a stress ball, and eventually, reluctantly, a bright white LED to the eyes. “Are you in there?”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“They won’t come out,” he finally replies, low and hoarse. “Even when I’m days off the street. There’s something inside me, something flashy, something they’re too attracted to. I invite them to go, I tip out, and they only cling tighter.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eSudden flashes now of loop-locked memory. “Does it feel reflective?” I ask. I’m uncertain if I should — what if that makes it somehow more salient, more real? And a chill runs down my spine, in my fingertips, when he nods.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eTethi drapes a readonly net over the boy’s head and mutters all sorts of reassuring things. I can totally picture him working the clinic. Now he swivels the display away so he and I can see the manifolds onscreen. And I don’t totally trust what I see there. I’ve spent so much time with it that I see those clawing spirals always in my peripheral vision. But it’s hard to argue that, fuzzy and weak though it is, the kid’s ‘folds are full of Sunflower Sieve debris.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“Is he a neikonaut?” I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“No way,” Tethi replies, panning, zooming, peering at more readouts.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“Then the inversion won’t take, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“That’s supposed to be your thing,” he hisses. “But we can’t use my rig. Chalkers cannot keep secrets. If \u003ci\u003eany\u003c/i\u003e of them find out what I’m doing down there, they’ll all know soon. I will be toast.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“Do you see them in there?” The Chalker boy asks.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“Yes. I do.” Tethi steadies his voice with false cheer. It’s not an outright lie — more like, it’s impossible to tell if any of these dripping, liquid manifolds could possibly originate with a Ripple. “You should stay here for a few days until they clear out. Min can find you a bunk.” But an hour passes in which we try to pretend all is well. We offer them packs of energy bars, and he leaves with his friends, casting apologetically back to Tethi as the door chimes shut.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“What does this mean?” We share a long, grim look. I find myself missing Yao.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“It means we’re going to need more headsets.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003c/section\u003e\\n\u003csection\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eI stay very late that night. The hours run together, the way things at Triple Point tend to do. I’m still soldering well past midnight.

Hands me the next board in exchange. “What?” He processes this a moment later. “Oh, very true. Thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“You’re going to need to account for the years,” I go on, head in the fumes again. “You say you’re not a Chalker. Fine. I believe you. But just how much time have you spent in there?”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eHe flicks a switch and the visor-screen in his hands goes dark. He turns the music down, hears Min puttering around just outside, and then turns it up even louder. “I don’t like talking about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“I understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“I \u003ci\u003ecan’t\u003c/i\u003e talk about it.

Only in broad strokes, through tears. His father was one of the architects of the Gabonese Fork, and Tethi fled for his life. The details fill themselves in, and they aren’t pretty.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“I wanted to train as a neikonaut. And I was stupid enough to think that Suowei owed me something. That they’d have a clue in the world who I was. None of that worked out.” He holds up a freshly assembled headset now. “This. There’s a reason this came to mind. \u003ci\u003eThis\u003c/i\u003e was the work I was able to find, selling rave gizmos outside clubs and parties. People would fuck with you. Mostly they were harmless, but out there you’re always on someone else’s turf. One night, I stepped on the wrong toes. They took my pushcart and left me in a very bad state. Left me to die.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eI stow the soldering iron.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“The thing is,” Tethi goes on, “I had no home ward. And when you have no ward alignment — you know which hospitals are going to treat you? Without a fuss, without getting the bluelights involved? Chalker hospitals. They peeled me off the ground. I recovered, and then made myself useful. I...\u003ci\u003egod. \u003c/i\u003eI wish I could put it into words, I really do. Five floors and a thousand eyes. The way the wind blew through the whole building at once, how that felt...” He falls silent, looking happy about something distant. It makes me glad to see him like this. “People like to say the Chalk steals people, so as not to admit that their friend or their kin made the choice. You always make the choice.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eI press. “And you make the choice to leave?”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“Well, Min took me in.” He pauses. This percolates. “Listen, I get it. If I found a mind-spanning megastructure with a twin in the Mirror Sea...” Tethi waves his arms expansively. “If I saw the Ripples were building something, I wouldn’t go to YINS for answers. I’d go to a Chalker.”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“Teth...”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003e“\u003ci\u003eBut I am choosing to leave this place.\u003c/i\u003e” He enunciates every syllable, sliding it under the music. “I need YINS to take me seriously, and that starts with you. Can you do that?”\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eCan \u003ci\u003eDeng\u003c/i\u003e do that? I’ve batted this question back and forth every night, trying to sleep.

I pull my jacket on, turn my collar up against the wind that makes its way up the block. It plays the tarps and tents of Triple Point, heavy flapping and low whistles. \u003ci\u003eThere’s something going on in there.\u003c/i\u003e The thought is harmlessly vague against the logistics of getting home. \u003ci\u003eThere are people going in there.\u003c/i\u003e Lone men, whole families, with their pushcarts and shopping bags. My blood runs dense and hot, watching them turn that gentle bend into the heart of Triple Point. Tethi did mention something about a night market.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eThe Chalkers have what people need: vegetables and painkillers and brake pads. They have what people want, too: hot youtiao and lily-waft perfumes and little cartridges with three hundred hits of 4-AcO-MET. But much of what they have is not so easy to judge as vitamin or vice, necessity or nicety. You won’t know in the moment, or for many months, why it drew your eye, why it was pressed into your hand. Your money is no good in there; you just need to be brave enough to step inside. I scan the faces that pass me, inscrutable in the dark. I wonder how many are looking for a totemic seedling of a new life, and how many just need to eat.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eAnd when I’m brave enough to step inside, sensation accumulates. Hot oil and and ripe fruit and pungent betel-nut linger long past the stimulus, myelinating the walls of my mind. No chatter, no laughter, no barter. Precious little light: of tiny, scrolling, monochrome displays, of blue-gas burners, of waxing moonglint on waxy mangoes. The lack is lucid. The mind finally free to consider rustling plastic, cool wind, the hundred different smells of shoes. No deliberation, no thinking twice. Decision, purchase, exchange, all made with loaded glance and portent gesture, objects simply taken, offered, swapped sight unseen in newspaper and twine. These thicken and blur into currents of exchange striated with desire and preference and ability and need, but whose?

Glints spicedense and cherrydeep, abundance offered from all to all, wretched twice-salvaged toys, dice, rice, stationery, batteries, genzhe globes, a bewildering array of ferrous powders, the abstraction and extrusion of treasure, the glint of possibility and synchronicity, the bellyfelt goldmelt annealing of need and have into unfurling, expansion, pure motile force, the deep assurance that there is enough, so take, and give, and take again, don’t be so bashful of what you are, for even the stars are the raw fact of consumption, and there’s no need to look down upon the stars.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eAbove me the near-full moon, its distance lonestrange face humming and golden, its tendrils expanding over the fundamental, rich, warm, darkness of —\u003cspan class=\\\"Apple-converted-space\\\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\u003eNo, over this \u003ci\u003estreet\u003c/i\u003e, over the rustle of the ginkgos!

And I am out the other side, turning over the intricate coincidence in my hands, the abstract way-thing, the color-flush hyperobject in this plastic shopping bag, the mingled relief and loss as I forget what I was meant to do with it, as it resolves into constituent pedestrian parts, into scissors and shave-gel and amphetamine drink-mix, and marble-sized prime-numbered voxelite buddhas, and a nearly intact conch shell, and a do-it-yourself dental kit.
