This is how I know she’s not upset with me for taking the week off. I needed a break, I told her, and it’s not exactly a lie. But of course she has no idea what I’m doing, or who with. So I’m careful, snooping around YINS late at night. Tethi’s parts list takes me through the engineering floors, where no one recognizes me. But he also wants Yao’s voxelite debris-skeleton. <i>Him??</i> Tethi was shocked when I told him the story over text. <i>He was so nice to me. </i>Sad face.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Combing the Safety floor now, my own footsteps put me on edge. <i>Label Your Voxelite Or It Will Be Recycled, </i>reads a sign by the wastebins, and that sends me digging through a bucket of sharp, clattering pieces. Interspersed, thankfully rarely, with the odd teabag or banana peel. An unexpected voice stops me cold. “If you people just marked your eggs, you wouldn’t be having these problems.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The man’s name is either Pan or Pang and I feel awful that I can never remember. He’s one of the cleaners that work their way through Building 1, usually getting to the basement well past midnight. I describe what I’m looking for.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“That’s a hot item,” he replies, getting a well-deserved chuckle out of this. “You’re a few days late to the scramble.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You’ve seen it?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I was just about to toss it the other night, and then two gals showed up. Both wanted it. One was a professor from this floor. The other, I’d never seen before.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">My spine shoots up. “Tall? Blonde, basically white hair? Real glamorous type?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Pfff, </i>he goes. “At YINS? Would’ve remembered that. She looked kinda nondescript.” He shakes a trash bag open. “If that helps.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“And who took it?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I left them to their business. Got business of my own.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So that puts me in the voxelite fab at three in the morning, still re-printing the debris samples, periodically sticking my head out the window for fresh air. And <i>that</i> puts me hours behind on sleep when I return to Triple Point. Tethi was up late, too; he already has breadboard sketches of the circuitry. He leads me back to the scanner room. From his monitors we watch the <i>wider</i> Sea, the <i>lower </i>Sea, the <i>outer</i> Sea — we taste different names for the part that’s visible from soberspace, where the Ripples still appear wild and unthinking. We point out traces of the golden scaffolding. Furtively, because sometimes we hear footsteps from passageways just below us. It stops us both cold.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Look at that,” I gasp. A Ripple coils itself lazily around a faint golden streak. Brushes it with obvious curiosity. The streak arcs for what seems like forever until it strikes another stellar node of their structure, an echo of their sunflower sphere.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“No, look at <i>that</i>,” Tethi mutters. In another corner, a second Ripple is doing the same thing. The motions match imperfectly, but they’re eerily synchronous.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Is this what it’s all for, then? Teleportation? Communication?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But Tethi snorts, and raps the convolution coprocessor. “I think we’re seeing the same Ripple twice. And that this thing is a piece of junk.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There are no wrong answers, hot-gluing the debris together. It fits together in a million different ways, a puzzle that’s no puzzle at all. No matter how we arrange it, it converges to match the skeletal hyperstructure the Mirror Sea. <i>What’s happening out there is happening in here.</i> The thought comes staccato between heartbeats. <i>The loop is closing, tightening, quickening.</i> The implications are obscure but nooselike, with the acrid smell of unhappy coincidence, the foreclosure of possibility into claustrophobic grooves. Tethi hums tunelessly as we work. He seems fascinated but fundamentally unbothered. But then, this tight intertwine of <i>out there</i> and <i>in here</i> is the core delusion on which the Chalk is built. He eats this stuff for breakfast.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You must have <i>some</i> idea of what it is,” I finally exclaim.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He doesn’t stop gluing. “And why would you say that?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Well, you want to go to YINS with this,” I press. “But if I found a mind-spanning megastructure with a twin in the Mirror Sea — if I thought the Ripples were building something, I wouldn’t go to YINS for answers. I’d go to a Chalker.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I’m not a Chalker,” he replies evenly. I cringe inwardly as he works a tricky joint with hot glue. But his tone remains mild. “I don’t blame you. It’s what I’d think, too. But if YINS is going to take me seriously, I need <i>you</i> to take me seriously. I am choosing to leave this place.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I’m sorry. I’m just panicking a little, is all.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It’s fine.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Really, Teth, I’m —”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It’s fine.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The descending silence is comfortable, all things considered. But the structure almost doubles in size before he speaks again. “For what it’s worth, if I did know what it was, I wouldn’t be able to verbalize it. That’s the tradeoff. <i>That’s </i>the Chalk.”</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">Min turns to me. “Watch the counter?”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She pulls on a coat and leaves. When, exactly, did <i>this</i> happen? Maybe it was last night, when she pulled us out of Tethi’s room, away from our little assembly line, and served us heaping portions of fish soaked with lemon and ginger. Maybe it was the day before that, when I helped them disassemble a busted trash collector to extract one pricey little coil. Or the day before that, when Min and Tethi together listed twelve songs containing the word <i>California</i> — in English, Mando, and Korean all three, as my face went darker and darker red. It has been…exactly how many days?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">All I know is I don’t mind it here. It’s quiet in a way that YINS can never manage, its walls always humming with current and coolant. The lack of Mirror Sea displays and their constant jump-scares is relief I didn’t know I needed. The assembly we’re doing is grueling, yeah. My fingers are burnt with hot plastic and solder and the shock of stray couplings. Tethi is a maestro; there are layers and layers to even the simplest neikotic devices that I will never again take for granted. He would do well at YINS — no, he <i>will</i> do well. Only he may have to convince me to go back with him.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Ghost-white faces in the window now. All that calm gone. I reach for the remote, faster than Min was, and the door makes a magnetic<i> whump</i>. Three Chalkers are banging frantically, menacingly, on the door. Nine-Eyes — maybe? Can’t tell in the twilight. I press another button, step two, the outer grate descends slowly…</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Wait,” Tethi shouts, emerging from the back. “They’re okay. Let them in.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">My mouth makes a kind of <i>what?</i> shape, but he gives me a look, and I give him the remote. The grate stops, the door opens, and now there are Chalkers in the building, for fuck’s sake. Foreheads with two, four, and five eyes. Don’t know what to make of that.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>“Did you fix it?”</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">With that voice, with the indoor lighting, a certain illusion dissipates. These are teenagers, young ones. Just about that age where the Weather Bureau stops trying to snatch you out of the Chalk, reasoning that you’ve made your choice. All in layers of old athletic wickwear, secondhand tentcloaks, gecko gloves with only a little stick left in ‘em. I realize, quite belatedly, that this is the trio I watched jump the Fengzhen wardgates. They greet Tethi — here my mind does some triangulating — like a cool older cousin.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I didn’t think you guys were ever coming back,” he tells them, overly morose. “I traded it for a pallet of telomerase smoothies.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“We <i>said </i>we were coming back,” the shortest one insists. Her Chinese comes with a thick North Korean accent.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“We got into a choir-bubble across the river is all.” The tallest of them I’d wager is Nigerian. He already towers over Tethi, deep-voiced but reed-skinny. “Felt into some clusters south-ways. Hard to leave once you’re in it. You know how it is.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You <i>know</i> how it is,” echoes the third one indignantly. Neither short or tall, and that’s all I can say about them. That particular Chalker vagueness hasn’t worn off in the few minutes they’ve been out of view of the cameras. My gaze slides off what amounts to a silhouette.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Nah, I’m fucking with you. Of course I fixed it.” Tethi grins and leads them to the back. I linger by the door. In a darkened storeroom, he stands on his toes to reach a clamshell case. “Refilled the fog, too,” he grunts. Inside the foam-lined box is a neatly spherical children’s quasigram projector.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>“OUR SOLAR SYSTEM,” </i>booms the speaker, when he flicks the switch.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I’ve <i>seen</i> this one,” the smallest one complains. She picks up a small controller and flips through some presets:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“<i>THE MILKY WAY GALAXY —”</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>“THE AMAZON RAINFOREST —”</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>“THE GOBI DESERT —”</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>“THE PACIFIC REEF BUILDERS —”</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>“THE MIRROR SEA OF SHANGHAI —”</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I learn a lot from the way they all react in the next few seconds. The one with the controller drops it and instinctually averts her eyes. The tall one flinches, but then flinches from the flinch. He seems to make a point of staring, entranced, at the projected Ripples, until Tethi blocks his view bodily. <i>“You know why,”</i> is all I can hear from their low, tense exchange.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And this melts neatly into a moment some hours later, the way things at Triple Point do. My tongue is between my teeth, my steady hand running liquid metal over tiny pins.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You’re going to need a résumé,” I say too loudly, too suddenly. “For YINS.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tethi nods approvingly at my soldering work. Hands me the next board in exchange. “What?” He processes this a moment later. “Oh, that’s true. Thanks.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You’re going to need to account for the years,” I go on, head in the fumes again. “You say you’re not a Chalker. Fine. I believe you. But just how much time have you spent in there?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He flicks a switch and the visor-screen in his hands goes dark. He turns the music down, hears Min puttering around just outside, and then turns it up even louder. “I don’t like talking about it.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I understand.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I <i>can’t</i> talk about it. It is categorically and precisely not possible to talk about.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“If this is going to work, I need more than that.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He sighs, but he knows I’m right. He scoots his chair, cracks his knuckles. “I told you why I came to Shanghai?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Yeah,” I reply, softly. I mean, only kind of. Only in broad strokes, only through tears. His father was one of the architects of the Gabonese Fork, and he fled for his life. The details fill themselves in, and they aren’t pretty.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I wanted to train as a neikonaut. And I was stupid enough to think that Suowei owed me something. That they’d have any idea who I was. None of that worked out.” He holds up a freshly assembled headset now: “This. I thought of this for a reason. <i>This</i> was the work I was able to find, selling rave gizmos outside clubs and parties. People would fuck with you. Mostly they were harmless, but out there you’re always on someone else’s turf. In this case it was Chalkers. They took my pushcart and left me in a very bad state. Left me to die.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I stow the soldering iron.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“But the thing is,” Tethi goes on, “I had no home ward. And when you have no ward alignment — you know which hospitals are going to take you in? Without a fuss, without getting the bluelights involved? Chalker hospitals. You couldn’t tell from the outside, but there was one three blocks away. I recovered, and then made myself useful in exchange. I stayed. I...<i>god. </i>I wish I could put it into words, I really do. Five floors and a thousand eyes. The way the wind blew through the whole building at once, how that felt...” He falls silent, looking happy about something distant. It makes me glad to see him like this. “People like to say the Chalk <i>steals</i> people, because they won’t admit that their friends and family made the choice. You always make the choice.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I thought you said Min took you in?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“That was later.” A pause. “Like I said, there are layers to it.”</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tethi talks about the Chalk in terms of tides. I already knew about the way it pulls people in — I’d heard less about the symmetrical way it pushes people out, sometimes just as violently, sometimes after taking years. And I can only take him at his word that the triple points are the shallows, that the locals from adjacent wards even come to their night market. You tend to imagine Chalkers living hand-to-mouth on stolen mangoes and penicillin. But you also hear of hospitals and riverbed submarines. Stories of the eerie effortlessness with which they feed and clothe the all-comers who fall through the cracks beneath the cracks. That takes money, which takes hustlers slumming it at the event horizon, like Tethi and Min.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I like Min. She never says much, but I like the incense she burns, the way she dusts, the cable bouquets she makes out of compulsion. I like watching her and Tethi exchange their quiet affection. But I wonder about her.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">On a Thursday, two days before the Mid-Autumn Festival, I arrive a little earlier than usual, mid-afternoon, and find the grate down. I wander, a little aimlessly, a little not, towards the center of Triple Point. Its stillness is eerier in the daytime, I decide. The flutter of tarps. Black-clad, retroactively visible blurs of motion. Were I more perceptive, more in the moment, I might be able to resolve these into individual Chalkers.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I feel a hand on my back.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“What are you doing here?” hisses Tethi. “We said five sharp.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He pulls me through his door, the one that’s very hard to see, and slams it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Jesus,” I hiss back. “What’s gotten into you? I — I have something. We should talk.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I have something too.” He locks as many doors as he can and, finally safe in his little scanner sanctuary, he elaborates. “The Bureau. They’re closing in, I saw them wandering around the mall this morning. We’re moving our operation in here.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Actually, he already has. His entire workstation: the printers and etchers and annealers, the scopes and soldering irons, the dozen deep drawers of diodes and dielectrics. We get to work immediately. This is one of the most poorly ventilated spaces you can imagine, and I’m thoroughly lightheaded by the time Tethi speaks, chewily, as he’s halfway through a sachima. “I’m sorry. I’m just on edge.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It’s fine. I get it.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The etcher drops another circuit board for him to inspect. “You said you had something?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Oh, fuck, that’s right.” I slide my swivel chair over to his desktop computer. “Can I use this? I have zero bars in here.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This turns into a snack break. While he dispenses boiling water into cup noodles, I follow nested onion links to a Mirror Sea message board that I pretend not to know about. I scroll quickly past <i>Pinned: Chalker Theories</i>, past two pages of quadratically motivated nonsense:</p>\n\n<p class=\"p3 mail\"><b> New Hyperlagmites?</b><br>\n&lt;0x3ad..7e1&gt; | 17 posts | Rank: flayling<br>\n<i>3 days ago<br>\n</i><br>\nSorry to keep this going but…<br>\n<br>\nYellow/golden streaks far in the background, visible on flats and quasis.

My husband is a neikonaut (won’t say where he works but let’s just say he’s been busy). He has been having bad dreams about specific shapes, but that is not unusual, it’s part of his job! My job is to keep his mind off that but he’s been describing them so vividly that I have been starting to see the same shapes in-sea (HKS, XUH). I drew some pictures, it’s hard to get it exactly right and I’m afraid to show him in case it makes it worse.<br>\n<br>\nThe really weird thing is that it’s a teeny tiny bit reflective.

You need to stay objective about this. Once we’re at YINS we can use Observatory hardware, and we can get a better view of this from soberspace. We’ll have resources.
