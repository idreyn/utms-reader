Actually, it usually goes the other way ‘round. The Phaseborn are just easier to notice. Once in a while, strolling the streets, you’ll find a Mirror Sea display that’s just — how do I put this — <i>in the way.</i> Gauzy meters of rollscroll unfurled across expressways in the dead of night. Jutting mazes of billboard, glowing too hot to linger in, collected in Renmin Square in an accumulation of unnoticed moments, during our collective saccades. Obelisks of old cell phones rising meters high from cauterized holes in tower lobbies. The Phaseborn erect these bewildering attention sinks in the dead of night or the heat of day, with all the earnest cheer of Blue Delta crews planting stormwater gardens. And the Nine-Eyes take them down with violent, serrated seriousness, before melting back into the crowd. I always suspected that they were in on it together, twin trunks spiraling back into the murky origins of the Chalk. But now, watching Tethi’s periodic glares towards the Phaseborn corraling revelers and checking tickets, I think I might have been wrong.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You gotta put the emphasis on the first syllable. Listen. <i>In</i>-tro-speeeecs!” He cups his hands, and his voice carries over the crowd loosely milling around one of the unknowably many entrances to Wu Ke Nai He. They joked that the club is vast enough to qualify as a ward — and stopped joking when they filed the paperwork. This little segment of it, on the southeast corner of a sprawling twelve blocks, Baidu Maps still thinks is a warehouse full of vacuum parts.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“No. C’mon. You sound like you’re selling hot dogs at a baseball game. In Mandarin, you gotta get a patter going. Take everything we have and string it all together, a little too fast.” Then, bringing my voice up into my nose: “Genzhe globes — Introspecs — Flower crowns — Quasi wands — Genzhe globes...” I rifle through our pushcart, layers of cheap plastic treasures pilfered from Min’s storeroom. “Christ, what else do we have in here?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He gave me the stink eye. “Hey, who’s done this before?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It was utterly endearing, the way he had it all ready to go when I arrived at Triple Point for the final time: the pushcart, the sorted piles of rave paraphernalia, a forged vendor’s permit to boot. Min came out to see us off, hands on her hips, faintly skeptical of the whole thing. “So <i>this</i> is how you’re spending the Mid-Autumn festival? Why not just enjoy things, Teth? Why be like this?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It’s fish in a barrel, <i>Min ayi</i>. We need the money.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She harrumphed. “No, good! Go, go on, take it out. None of it sells in the shop.” Then, turning to me with a sly smile: “This is how I found him, you know. Selling this absolute junk on the streets.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Something passed between them then, broadband and narrowbeam, that I wasn’t privy to. I had questions about the story they couldn’t quite keep straight. And surely <i>she</i> had questions about Tethi’s backpack, big enough to live out of for some indefinite future. But they kept up the charade ’til he was outside. Then he turned on his heel, just as the door chimed open, and they embraced in the warm light of the shopfront. I watched from under the concrete as he wiped away her tears, held back his own. <i>I will, I will, </i>I thought I heard him say.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We rode the em-train, mostly in silence, clear across the city. Tethi kept setting his reflection straight in the windows, and I kept not noticing how his lips wobbled at the edges. Wu Ke Nai He was where the Nine-Eyes first peeled him off the sidewalk: he didn’t have to tell me, and I didn’t ask. But that was the shadow of his insistence that their Mid-Autumn parties were the stuff of legend. That I’d understand once inside why this had to be the place.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“<i>In</i>-tro-speeeecs!”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Oh, yeah, Introspecs: </span><span class=\"s2\">what might be sunglasses, every edge a curve, a hi-res screen conjoining the outer lenses. The stems have very simple UTMS sensors, used to divine the wearer’s emotion and splash it in color across their eyes. They were red-hot a few years ago, and Min had hundreds of unsold pairs. We spent a hellish, weird, wonderful week cracking open as many as we could and rewiring them into Sunflower Sieve debris detectors. Now we’re each wearing a pair, unmodified ones. Probably a coincidence that we’re both showing yellows and greens.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">“A pair each for me and my girl.” Our sixth customer, our first neikonaut. He’s short with us, distracted, obviously on something. His hard wallet opens with a <i>ka-click</i> worth more than my life.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">“Two hundred for the both,” Tethi decides. I grab two pairs of Introspecs: one with a sticker and one without. Will they notice that one is heavier than the other, crammed with radios and extra sensors? They will not. They’re listing colors to each other, running out of obvious ones, delighting in this. “For the lady.” I hand her the unmarked pair and, giggling, she slides them over his eyes. Snatches the marked pair — the Sunflower Sieve debris detector — for herself. They saunter away.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">“<i>Fuck</i>,” Tethi whispers. <i>“Sa mère la pute.”</i> He makes a slashing note on his spreadsheet, still grumbling. “We need to get in closer. We’re not making any sales over here.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">“You’re on edge. The main act isn’t on for three hours.” But I follow him as he wheels his cart across the street, across the ward boundary, into Phaseborn territory. I know he’s daring the Chalkers who run this place to come give us a hard time. I’m worried he wants a fight. They come upon us three to a whirlwind, inscribing tighter and tighter circles around us, their black garb merely latex spray and haphazard puffs of mycogenic foam. A similar gloss of white on their faces, over their lips, into their nostrils, shorn even of eyelashes. Converging in front of us and asking with terrifying, matte-black blinks, <i>what gives?</i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>There’s a particular unexpression to uniformly dark eyes. A particular way they can’t move their faces under the gloss. Tethi meet their wordless challenge with his own restrained contortions, smooth, but a little stiff, and I’m worried he’s doing this with a Nine-Eyes’ accent and <i>what then</i>, but how can I possibly be the judge of what passes between them. After the Phaseborn drift away, I realize he hasn’t blinked for a full minute.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">“So we can stay here?” I whisper, duly impressed.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">He wrinkles his nose, just because he can. “Until the next ones come by.”</span></p>\n</section>"}}],"post":["$","div",null,{"className":"ChapterQuickNav_chapterQuickNav__EXp_8","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"ChapterQuickNav_previous__EhnLJ","children":["$","$Lb",null,{"href":"/read/hyperlagmites","children":"← Back"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"ChapterQuickNav_contents__HfJVg","children":["$","$Lb",null,{"href":"/read","children":"Contents"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"ChapterQuickNav_next__HJcYI","children":null}]]}],"useSerifBodyFont":true}],null],"segment":"__PAGE__?{\"slug\":\"wu-ke-nai-he\"}"},"styles":[]}],"segment":["slug","wu-ke-nai-he","d"]},"styles":[]}],"segment":"read"},"styles":[]}]}]}]}],null]
