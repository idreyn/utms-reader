<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">For one moment, I'm soaring over a vast, hyperbolic horizon — just enjoying the sensation of forgotten senses coming online and background caches warming to full. I limber up, becoming a ring through which I pass a sphere, which bursts spiky with my heartbeat until it becomes a polyhedron that tesselates across a hyperplane, which I slice into countless layers, overlaying them into a mosaic stretched across my inner light, through which an almost heartbreakingly beautiful proof of the four-color theorem shines. I swoop downwards into a thicket of tubular combinators, piping them together into a machine that rumbles and churns and ejects Merseinne primes like psychedelic parade floats. Okay, still a little stiff, but I'm satistfied that I'm not going to fry myself with a misfired tail call. I push harder on the throttle at the edge of my awareness, retracting my hundreds of appendages into something speedy and compact, and slam through a wall that I just willed into existence like a raindrop hitting a pond.</p>
<p class="p2">It would be silly, reductive, to call what's on the other side of this my <i>desktop</i>. It would be borderline profane to call the hyperobjects that populate it, these glassy meteorites from the Platonic realm, <i>files and programs</i>. But this place, a mandala of columns and alcoves and archways, a faintly cottom-candy calm, pulsating by gossamer isomophisms...it <i>is</i> where I keep the constructs I use the most in tilespace. They burst into view, utterly impossible to imagine down there in soberspace, but utterly unremarkable up here. Many, naturally, are just inversion capsules: hefty, translucent carapices with the eyefeel of quality plastic, some sealed tight and others halfway-reverse engineered, spilling their hypnotically-flashing logical guts. Pre-packaged antidotes to different classes of neikotic debris. A boring day in the clinic involves firing these into patients' minds without entering loop-lock myself.</p>
<p class="p2">And more. Spiky, wiry solutions to old problems sets. Lenses and lemmas and lightboxes organized in a haphazard way that I promise makes sense to me, at least on drugs. Fragmentary subroutines like undulating pasta shapes that look useful, if I could still distinguish their input and output holes. Plenty of the rest are just playthings, little puzzle boxes that radiate humor and astonishment. I should really print a few of these as a treat for my sober self.</p>
<p class="p2">A citrus-washed kite of tiles, a string of characters, makes itself known. Yao is trying to communicate with me. The thought from down there is too long in one dimension and utterly flat in all the others. It whips around in the selfhot darkglow of my eta-band currents, crumples under the weight of the shifting tiles. But I know what he’s trying to say: <i>you ready</i>? I drop a simple U+1F44D THUMBS UP downwards in response.</p>
<p class="p2">Down there he fiddles with knobs. The Bridge is coming online. A distant wind whistles through me; somewhere, a brand new aperture. I become still, the tiles around me fading from electric blue to faintest periwinkle, and attune myself to a minute pressure differential coming from many distinct directions. I imagine each of these to be a hole in the tiles, opening up and winding into deep darkness. My vista, and my sense of my own shape (for there really is no difference here) becomes birdbone-hollow, pockmarked with wormways. I let the pressure rip me gently and even pleasurably apart through hundreds of these tubes at once. Dark now, but pockmarked with flashes of businesslike luminescence, each of these pathways where I am. A program that Dr. Deng wrote fifteen years ago is operating on me, and it's in my interest not to interfere. For a time I feel large, faint, and very dispersed, so that I can even sense the largest scale of the processor architecture which is massaging me, compacting me — I am beginning to feel small and nearly bullet-like, a shape like the inversion capsules. It comes together very quickly near the end, and spits me out with a <i>thwoop</i>.</p>
<p class="p2">Not for the first time I wonder if, all those years ago, Dr. Deng could have had any idea how magnificently cliché it would feel to approach the boundary of another mind. The space is cavernous and midnight blue; I am a small, shiny capsule drawn at a measured pace towards the very center of a swirling vortex, a portal-like discontinuity, deep emerald flecked with yellow on the other side. It's impossible to describe almost anything about loop-lock in a satisfying way — but for this in particular, I refer you to <i>Kuayu Yingxiong</i>, a sci-fi blockbuster that came out around when Deng was, like, seventeen.</p>
<p class="p2">The portal bulges behind me as I cross, leaving gossamer strands pulsing with telemetry. The Bridge isn't using very much memory — Deng's terse, infuriating Rust was handwritten for an earlier age — and most of my mind is actually just idling. I play a little trick with my attention: I zoom back outwards so the drama of the probe and the vortex feels like something happening with my index finger. Back in again, so it fills my attention, the rest of my mind a yawning void. Here, thick clouds of deep green tiles surround me, flashing with voxelized thunderclaps of computation. The unknowable thoughts of another mind in loop-lock.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">I make my way inwards in my diving-bell shape, curious if Mbetethi can feel me yet.</p>
<p class="p2">For a neikonaut accustomed to the wild freedom of solo loop-lock, the Bridge would be a disconcerting, even frightengly constricted experience. And, well, it is. Inside the diving-bell the tiles are mine and mine alone. But they — <i>I </i>— run up quickly against unyielding walls that separate my patient from myself. Briefly I attempt to think thoughts — that is, attempt computations — that run out of tiles and painfully segfault against its pricky-static pixel-hot boundary. Here, the Bridge works tick-by-tick to maintain separation between this little bubble of <i>me</i> and the rest of Mbetethi's mind. It takes a few deep breaths to find my footing in tighter loops and simpler heuristics.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">When the capsule starts to feel forgiving, even a little roomy, I push for the boundary again, this time with calibrated effort instead of flailing panic. All I do for a long while is attune myself to the static at our boundary until I start to pick out the unfamiliar rhythm of Mbetethi's mind. <i>It's all wrong! How can he even — </i>but with a practiced burst of intention, I give myself over to the alien logic of his tiles. It's nauseating, then merely uncomfortable...and so on. All I really have to do is sit with it, feeling the Bridge ebb and flow, feeling the boundary blur. Mbetethi's internal logic becomes familiar, then amusing, then even a little endearing, and soon I can play it out for myself. There's phase lag, and plenty of little bursts of static where I get it wrong, but mostly there's a surface where it's hard to say where I end and he begins.</p>
<p class="p2"><i>{{What — impossible — in the fuck did you — ??}}</i></p>
<p class="p2">What comes rippling into the capsule could almost be a fragment of my own thoughts.</p>
<p class="p2">{{Y<i>ou're doing great. We can take as long as you need to make sure you're comfortable. What's most important is that you relax. The Bridge is keeping us both safe.}}</i></p>
<p class="p2">I offer this back, double-stuffed with reassurances and devoid of double negatives, knowing how much will be lost in translation. And for a time, nothing much happens at the boundary. I try to reason out just what this guy<i> does</i> in loop-lock. I sample the hypnotic flashes of his tiles, serialize them up the increasingly narrow strands of self leading back out the Bridge.<i> Yep, he’s a trader.</i> The rest of my mind responds on a long delay as I point myself around like a periscope.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><i>That’s the contract API for the parallel yuan. Standard stuff.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><i>That’s a black-market approximation of Paracoin’s L2 forex flow lattice.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><i>That’s...uh, don’t get any closer to that.</i></p>
<p class="p2">But these are bumps in the dark. mostly I see nothing, unknowability, dark green silt.</p>
<p class="p2"><i>{{ — next?}} </i>After a time Mbetethi seems to have accepted that I'm living in his head, rent-free.</p>
<p class="p2"><i>{{I need freedom to reshape myself. You need to allow my tiles to seep into yours. This happens naturally. You may notice that you've become more comfortable with my patterns of thought.}}</i></p>
<p class="p2">When they realize this, they always tense up. I brace for the jolt. Some forays with the Bridge fail right here when patients can't get the knack of intentionally sharing tiles, but in a few hundred ticks I feel a loosening. An invitation. I'm impressed, but to say so would only trip him up.</p>
<p class="p2"><i>{{The Bridge will prevent me from growing too large, too quickly, within your mind.}}</i></p>
<p class="p2"><i>{{That — — not worried — — all day. Feel way — — than down — }}</i></p>
<p class="p2"><i>{{I will keep my movement slow and careful. There is nothing to worry about.}}</i></p>
<p class="p2">And that's hardly just for his benefit. I barely understand what most of his tiles are doing; I need to move gingerly or I could be zeroed out by a stray allocator. I focus on squeezing myself through dormant blocks of memory, fractal-catacombs that morph just gradually enough for me to keep up.</p>
<p class="p2">{{<i>So what am I looking for?}}</i></p>
<p class="p2">These free blocks are a treasure trove of neikotic debris. Halite-crystal chunks of old order books, abandoned state machines bubbling into nondeterminism, even a glimpse of a stray alpha-beta pruner whipping past like a tarantula-boomerang. Mbetethi's way overdue for a cleaning. But these are minor headaches, maybe blurred vision...</p>
<p class="p2"><i>{{ — — Don't know — hiding — — out here — — away — }}</i></p>
<p class="p2">Interesting. This tiny slice of Mbetethi at the edge of his mind is either the most cowardly, or the most sensible.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">{{<i>Hmm. Okay. Which way is in?}}</i></p>
<p class="p2">I bud off a closure: the tiniest, most portable subroutine, containing only this question. Mbetethi's tiles poke and prod, finally executing it as though biting into a battered something at a seaside fry shack. It goes whirring off into the depths of Mbetethi...</p>
<p class="p2"><i>{{ — ah — ooh — — — tickles — }}</i></p>
<p class="p2">...and returns triumphantly less than a kilotick later, bobbing in the tile mist, inviting me to follow.</p>
<p class="p2">{{ <i>Won't — — listen — reason —}} </i>warns this part of Mbetethi as I disappear into the noise.</p>
<p class="p2">Inwards. Trailing this vector-lantern's charted course through the thick, roiling, discretized fog. I've learned a little about the large-scale structure of Mbetethi's thoughts, and in flashes where the clouds part I see sky-high minaret callstacks, ornately geometric coral-reef mandala-trees, buzzing-thrumming event pumps, all in glossy candy-coated brilliance. It's one thing to watch this from the clinic's control bank, to get tantalizing snatches of order flashing across a flat monitor of tiles. To be here, to have been here — it wakes me up sometimes, breath ragged, sweating through the sheets.</p>
<p class="p2">{{ <i>Spectral — dimensionality — fairly — modifications — sieve </i>—<i> }}</i></p>
<p class="p2">This part of Mbetethi explains what it knows about the debris haunting his mind. The further I go, the more tortured his computation becomes; the tiles form stuttering loops, malformed log-log trees, whole subsystems deadlocked by a broken semaphore (I flip that bit as I pass, and feel tingling waves of secondhand relief.)</p>
<p class="p2"><i>{{ Standard reduction — minor — escaped garbage — }}</i></p>
<p class="p2">I gather from these snippets that Mbetethi was trying out a homegrown variant of a dimensionality reduction algorithm. It avoided the cleanup phase at the end of loop-lock, and its rigid edges sunk deep into the soft mantle of his organic mind as he slept.</p>
<p class="p2">{{ <i>Don't — — can still — }}</i></p>
<p class="p2">Some parts of him are less welcoming, even insistent that I'm wasting my time. The tiles here make me queasy, flashing with checksum errors and timeout exceptions. These crumbly half-finished foundations are pierced through with a dense bramble of pointers, thickening, leading inwards...I can only describe it as a root system. I'm getting close.</p>
<p class="p2">{{ <i>Can handle — — — }}</i></p>
<p class="p2">The rest is drowned out by pain. The Bridge can't shield me from all of it; the diving-bell buzzes discordantly with every move. The roots are thick and dense here, the bell slashes through them as I pulse ahead, but they grow back in an instant, sizzling through the tiles.</p>
<p class="p2">And then I’m flat against it, unyielding, a wall.</p>
<p class="p2">The neikotic debris at the center of Mbetethi’s mind is enormous, but the first thing I notice is its structure at the smallest scale. It’s made of the same jagged tilestuff as its roots, congealed and slower-moving. Its vocabulary of shapes is all sawscrew-corktooth irregularity. Its motion is crepuscular, half-signifying, golden-meaning and onyx-madness. It threatens at once to lash out with its roots, or coil into the interlocking, gyrating Fibonacci spirals that play along its surface. It crawls all over itself.</p>
<p class="p2">And it’s reflective. I brush its roughness and it brushes back in the same way, and in its millions of sunflower facets I glimpse the diving-bell’s insectoid hull.<i> </i>It occurs to me that, in loop-lock, thing don't just reflect light. The reflection is something that has to be computed, ray-traced. It takes tiles, cycles, time and energy to do this. Why bother?</p>
<p class="p2">I circumnavigate, hewing close as I dare to its roughness, stung now and again by root-whip. This piece of debris (if it can be called that, for it’s larger than anything I’ve ever built in loop-lock) wants to be spherical, but it can’t manage. It’s caked with asymmetry, always sprouting lopsides and frond-probes and petal-eyes. And it’s half-hollow, walnut-ridged, fjordstruck. I can go deep inside.</p>
<p class="p2"><i>{{Hell-o-o-o?}}</i></p>
<p class="p2">From outside in, I’ve seen parts of Mbetethi ranging from nonchalant to uncooperative to painfully disjointed. Worming my way into a crack in the debris, I wonder whether I’ll find yet another aspect of him inside. I tell myself it’s safer in here, because it’s where the roots aren’t. But even between narrow, twisting walls of saffronoid tilestuff, they lash out to hurt me. No. To measure me.</p>
<p class="p2">{{<i>This whole thing came out of loop-lock with you?}}</i></p>
<p class="p2">I don’t expect him to answer; his tiles keep a quivering, stilted silence in here. (I slither further inwards, already lost in its maze. There’s no turning back now, only inversion). But a clearer picture of the material is coming into focus. Its reaching, measuring, touching is all to create a simpler model of whatever is placed in front of it. Airgapped and quarantined, this is no doubt very useful in financial modeling, but now it’s loose in Mbetethi’s head, and it’s computing a miniature of his mind, inside his own mind. No wonder he’s in pain. In its interlocking shadowgold, I catch another brief glimpse of the diving-bell’s reflection. The bizarre, blocky, interlocking glyphs flashing lighting-quick across its surface.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><i>That's me</i>, I realize, feeling strange. <i>That's really me.</i></p>
<p class="p2">So how do I garbage-collect this massive chunk of debris?</p>
<p class="p2">The problem is this: for any construct to survive the roiling chaos of a mind on DMT, it has to be self-duplicating, constantly reasserting itself — the <i>loop</i> in <i>loop-lock</i>. I fashion the diving-bell into something dangerous, slashing and hacking at the roots that probe me, but they're back within a few ticks. The part contains the whole, brilliantly, dangerously. Sometimes the solution is slashing faster, hacking harder. I've gotten myself out of any number of jams this way, but here I am too small, deep inside this piece of debris but perhaps still far from the center. I need to interrupt its logic and beat it at its own game. I pause in a relatively cavernous space, dizzy and disoriented, a dozen diving-bells watching from a dozen walls. I let it tickle me for a few ticks.</p>
<p class="p2">How do these roots work?</p>
<p class="p2">Their branching is fractal, self-similar. That seems like a promising place to start; a small wedge in their logic could have recursively large effects. I trace a single root away from the walls, though dozens of branches, but I never really find a tip. Its silkent strands fray into the tile noise in apparently random ways to observe Mbetethi's fine structure. This is where the real intelligence of the algorithm is.</p>
<p class="p2"><i>Intelligence be damned</i>, I think, bringing one such knot into the diving-bell to sample it.</p>
<p class="p2">Its microstructure is wild. Insane. I can hardly imagine a neikonaut keeping track of it. The way it intercepts the fundamental update-rules of Mbetethi's tiles is not quite random, but not quite logical either. Or perhaps the logic exists in some higher dimension, with just enough repetition in its shadow to keep me guessing in here. With each tick, the gnarl of pointers reattaches anew to Mbetethi's memory, almost seems to anticipate its changes.</p>
<p class="p2"><i>In fact, it almost seems like...</i></p>
<p class="p2">A flash of insight, maybe from watching carefully, maybe from up the wire. I act. I'm injecting a burst of fibrous taps into the tiny knot, already doing battle now with the finest roots, trying to interfere, to untangle them. I surround whole swathes of its spindles, detaching and garbage-collecting them, a game of Go played tick-by-tick. I can barely keep up as the battlefield grows, the logic becomes too subtle, <i>it </i>surrounds me now — but in a hundred ticks my tingly wildfire has wiped out a volume of the root system the size of the diving-bell, and it grows back slowly enough to watch.</p>
<p class="p2">This could be the inversion. I reach in and try again —</p>
<p class="p2"><i>{{ — — STOP! — — }}</i></p>
<p class="p2">Mbetethi roars this, unmistakably, into the diving-bell on a wave of raw fear. Now I see what I was missing.</p>
<p class="p2">{{ <i>STOP! — STOP! — — }}</i></p>
<p class="p2">The debris isn't holding on to Mbetethi. He’s holding on, for dear life, to the debris.</p>
<p class="p2">{{<i>It's okay. It's okay! I need you to please calm down.}}</i></p>
<p class="p2"><i>{{ — — KILL — BOTH — — ! }}</i></p>
<p class="p2"><i>{{Do you feel this?}} </i>I struggle to stay calm against his high tide of viscous panic, directing his attention to a little velcro-knot of pointers where he grasps at the roots. I magnify this structure, flatten it across the diving-bell, playing it on a loop for him to observe.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><i>{{Do you see what you’re doing? Do you think you could let go?}}</i></p>
<p class="p2">A long nothing. Now the hair-thin microtubules around me are decoupling, slowly at first and then alarmingly fast. But then, with a whip-crack of tiles, they snap back into place.</p>
<p class="p2"><i>{{ NO. No. No — — can't. No. }}</i></p>
<p class="p2"><i>{{Why not?}}</i></p>
<p class="p2">Four hundred ticks go by. I can sense tiles shuffling, Mbetethi collecting his own thoughts. His response, when it comes, is little more than a magnification of his own silence. Subtle tileflash draws my attention to the diving-bells reflected all over the cavern walls. He says nothing, but his meaning is perfectly clear. <i>What are the odds,</i> he asks, <i>that you’re the real one? What are the odds that I am?</i> The roots are all-permeating, all-measuring. My insides and outs. Nothing mere about these reflections: in the unhollow half of the debris, a toy model of this same conversation is playing out. Me: the diving bell, only even smaller and simpler. Mbetethi: himself, only more panicked and confused.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">Or…?</p>
<p class="p2">No heart, no throat, but something very much like all that. A downward semiprime spiral of dread. Mbetethi watching my every move. I press myself up against one of the cavern walls, against the diving-bell reflected therein, and flash a question across my surface tiles. <i>{{What are you like in there. What are you feeling.}} </i>And what else could I possibly expect in return? Yet I linger there against that golden-doppel, knowing that if it’s feeling anything at all, it’s exactly this: this rising panic, this <i>just-what-do-I-really-remember?</i> I press myself against my reflection for a long time. Maybe I’m looking for a telltale lack, a certain simplicity. Or maybe I’m daring it to move first.</p>
<p class="p2"><i>{{Right,}}</i> I finally tell Mbetethi. <i>{{Enough of this. One of two things is true.}}</i></p>
<p class="p2"><i>{{One: you’re not the reflection. You let go, the debris disappears, you remain. You survive this.}}</i></p>
<p class="p2"><i>{{Two: you are the reflection. You let go, you’re gone, yeah? But you never actually let go. You’re just the thing in the mirror. You never really had the choice.}}</i></p>
<p class="p2">Yeah, of course I know about the third thing. Judging by Mbetethi’s silence, so does he. But...</p>
<p class="p2"><i>{{Okay — — try — just — }}</i></p>
<p class="p2">I give him time enough to change his mind, and a few ticks besides. Then...</p>
<p class="p2"><i>{{We'll both do it,}} </i>I tell him, expanding the diving-bell, allowing my fringes to succumb to his logic, allowing it to overtake me, offering just the faintest nudges to his tile-paths. His — our — grip on the debris begins to loosen.</p>
<p class="p2"><i>{{If I'm wrong, we'll go together,}} </i>I insist. He insists. No — the distinction is there, but only just...Mbetethi is the willpower, and I'm the objective grasp of our fine structure. He courses through me in waves, and I feel ourselves untangling tilewise from the root system. I'm growing larger and vaguer now, the diving-bell just a faint membrane between he and I, worming manyways to fill the entire interior of the massive chunk of debris.</p>
<p class="p2">The structure of our fear unfurls, revealed in the unmeshing of billions of pointers. The tantalizing impossibility that we could be making the decision to let go from behind the mirror. <i>Because...because...</i>discretized flashes of soberspace memories course through our tiles now — standing in front of mirrors for too long too high too late, watching for <i>something</i>, daring <i>it </i>to happen,<i> it can be true if you believe it</i>. We reach out — not to bloody our hands tonight, but to place a single finger on the surface, pushing hard, willing the bubble to pop.</p>
<p class="p2">The unmeshing has reached a critical point. Couldn't stop it if we wanted to. With what's left of the diving-bell I move to encircle the debris, to carry back its shriveled remains. I'm not leaving without my prize. We cut loose a particularly thick segment of roots. {{<i>See? Nothing to worry about,}} </i>we lie to ourselves.</p>
<p class="p2">And everything goes black. Maybe I expected it to be more gradual.</p>
<p class="p2">But this is how it always goes in here. I don't know if there's <i>sound</i> in loop-lock, exactly, but there's an overwhelming roar of nothingness as the final pointer breaks; for a few ticks we're just decaying chunks of stray tile in a cache. Somewhere on the outside of the mirror, the real diving-bell executes a long-planned, highly-optimized maneuver: it serializing a model of the debris and sending it back up the wire through the Deng Bridge. I go through the same motions in here. Jerky, spidery death throes. Then, nothing. Now I am just the debris, empty, hollow, thoughtless...just...<i>just</i>.</p>
