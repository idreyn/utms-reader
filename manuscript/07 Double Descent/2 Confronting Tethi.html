<p class="p1">There he is, in a makeshift corner booth, among spooled miles of fiber-optic cable. I spy him in the half-half-light behind black tarpaulin curtains, hunched in a too-small folding chair opposite a wiry neikonaut sporting a half-hood and pneumatic Rolex. An upended spool between them serves as a low table and is covered — as I suspect all surfaces in Mbetethi’s presence quickly are — with all kinds of neikological miscellany. My general impression is of a kind of loading-dock fortune teller’s booth, which is greatly enhanced by the fact that both men are hunched over a tiny, gleaming orb.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">I don’t know how to knock on a tarp. I give it a little tug instead, and that’s when I realize there’s a third guy, must be six eight and religous about trenbolone, lurking behind it. He’s bald as a rock, but somehow I doubt he’s a neikonaut. Somehow I doubt he’d fit in our scanner chair.</p>
<p class="p1">“Hey,” he growls, arresting me by the shoulder and pushing me a full three feet backwards along the linoleum.“Don’t you know how to knock?”</p>
<p class="p1">The wiry neikonaut, who is gazing at the orb in a kind of trance, doesn’t react. Mbetethi looks up and squints into the dim light, sounding utterly bored. “He’s still got ten minutes.” Signals the numeral with his hand. So I post up nearby, watching two people slice open a styrolite crate of coolant tanks and offer wildly different appraisals of its contents. And not five minutes later, the big guy gives me a gentle tap on the shoulder. “He’s ready for you.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Ten thousand,” Mbetethi says to the bottom of his glass when I enter. “For thirty minutes. If you are unable to hatch it in that time, go home and read Chapter 8 of K&amp;K, and we’ll try again, half off.”</p>
<p class="p1">His Mandarin has a pleasant Afro-French twinge to it, and though this is the first time I’ve heard him <i>speak</i>, I recognize a certain three-four musicality from his tiles.</p>
<p class="p1">“Let me see it,” I tell him. And to my surprise, still not really seeing me, he dips into a jacket pocket and tosses a baseball-sized orb of voxelite into the air. As it spins I get only the briefest glimpse of what’s inside — brilliant yellow jets like the sun’s rays, emanating from a black and beady core. In the same fluid motion, he catches the neikotic egg and it disappears with his hand beneath the table.</p>
<p class="p1">“Ten thousand ping,” he repeats. “Half an hour.”</p>
<p class="p1">I reach into my own bag, which our muscular friend does not like one bit, and produce Mbetethi’s N-1 license. “I was hoping we could arrange something?” I’m going for <i>listen, pal</i> but it comes out more <i>could I get an extension on this paper?</i></p>
<p class="p1">“I have dozens of these,” he laughs. “I —” Finally, he recognizes me. His face takes a round trip from mild, <span class="s1">pleasasnt surprise</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s3">[not exactly!]</span> to pallid shock, and back again. “Dr. Xu — how did you — why —?”</p>
<p class="p1">“I’m not a doctor,” I grumble. “And I have some questions for you.” <span class="s1">Suddenly I see an opening like a bird of paradise on a telephone wire, just <i>sitting</i> there. Mbetethi is casually palming the egg, too casually, now and I’m lunging to snatch it and just <i>run</i> back to YINS, and now I’m belly-down on the table and I hear the <i>whir</i> of a vialgun at my back.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You can’t possibly have thought that would work. Big fish — no, it’s fine. Could we please have the room?”</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s3">[Instead of doing this, Mona should pour her debris onto the table.]</span> Only after I sit back down and dust myself off, my pride scraped but not dented, do I realize that Big Fish is the hired muscle. He shrugs and ducks out of the little booth.</p>
<p class="p1">At this point Mbetethi turns and folds his arms, more with detached amusement than anything resembling real anger. “What kind of stupid are you, exactly? You realize this isn’t one of your poster sessions? No one is here handing out stress balls, and little clicky clicky pens with the names of benzodiazepines?”</p>
<p class="p1">I regard the egg, which Mbetethi is now sort of sitting on. “That <i>thing</i> of yours has made my life a living hell over the last week.” Not strictly true, but I pronounce it so with the required dramatic effect. “Do you have any idea how many people you’ve sent to my clinic? This is how you repay me for pulling that shit out of you?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Thank you for saving me.” He says this quite seriously, and lets it hang in the air for a moment. “How many?”</p>
<p class="p2">“I...<i>I</i> don’t know! Probably a hundred at this point.”</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That number seems to surprise him. “And I suppose one of them led you here,” he ventures, sounding a tiny bit betrayed.</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s3">[Another refrence to the debris on the table here.]</span></p>
<p class="p1">“<i>One of them</i> had a grand mal seizure! Ruptures in his cranial arteries! Plus — it’s Double Descent, dude.” I wave my arm around vaguely, as if totally unimpressed with Shanghai’s neikological black market. “It’s actually kind of lame.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Just one of them?”</p>
<p class="p1">“<i>Just</i> one of them?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Well, look at the numbers.” He says this so earnestly, so evenly, that I have no choice but to direct my attention to the numbers. “This class of algorithm is known to produce bad neikotic debris. Comes with the territory. I even make them sign a little release form, just like you.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Really?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Of <i>course</i> not. The point is that probably one in a hundred really serious bits of debris has a nasty neurological complication. You said you’ve seen a hundred patients, so I’m right in the money! Am I not?”</p>
<p class="p1">I fold my arms.</p>
<p class="p1">“I am making them <i>rich</i>...” He waves his hand lazily, clearly forgetting something.</p>
<p class="p1">“Mona. Like the painting.”</p>
<p class="p1">“I am making them <i>rich</i>, Mona. They are going out there and tearing holes in the polyquasal derivatives market, in counterfactuals, in forex. Some of them will probably retire. They understand the risks! A little brain hemorrhage...bing, bang, <i>et voila. </i>A giant vacation home in Bali.”</p>
<p class="p1">He sounds so much like a proud scout leader that my original theory is going out of focus. Mbetethi — the name sounds Gabonese, and the accent sure sounds French. It wouldn’t have been <i>crazy</i> to assume that it was a malicious act on his part, a mass poisoning of Suowei Financial’s best and brightest for the havoc they brought upon his home country...</p>
<p class="p1">“So let me learn it.” I lean across the table, look him square in the eyes. “Give me thirty minutes with it. Hell, give me fifteen for five thousand.” Do I have five thousand ping? Maybe, kinda. “I’m a YINS neikologist, I’ve got a little <i>guangpan</i> in me, and I just read Chapter 8 of K&amp;K.” I’m bluffing wildly, and Mbetethi is absolutely eating it up. But he shakes his head calmly.</p>
<p class="p1">“Not you.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Oh? Not me?” I keep my eyes steady on his. In fact, I’m having a hard time tearing them away, and it seems he is too. It seems that a tiny, jerking oscillation passes between us as he gauges my intent.</p>
<p class="p1">“Because you’re going to write a paper about it. Tell me you’re not.”</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I can’t tell him I’m not.</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s3">[The vantablack spikiness needs to come into play here.]</span> But I’m getting genuinely irked at this point, not just at those brilliant pearly whites, that amused indifference, but at the way something about our time in the Deng Bridge lingers in this conversation, in the faint xylophonic interplay of the tiles behind the words. Something <i>happened</i>, something neither of us can remember — and I am made to feel as though, <span class="s1">last we met</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s3">[need a solid reference to the diving-bell here.]</span>, I yanked a tooth from him without warning or consent. He knows it, I know it, and he knows I know it, and it’s driving me crazy that I don’t know how to just bring it up.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Well, I think it’s the least you could do,” I insist, tilted, my voice curling at the edges. “You’re <i>poisoning</i> all these people and sending them to me to fix. God knows I hate Suowei Financial as much as anyone else in Shanghai —”</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s3">[Maybe: Tethi responds to something she didn’t quite say aloud here.]</span></p>
<p class="p1">“No you do not.” Mbetethi’s speech is suddenly flat and guarded, and my stomach burbles with an unpleasant admixture of phenethylamine and regret. Had I been aiming for that nerve? “<span class="s1">And I’d appreciate —</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s3">[stronger]</span>”</p>
<p class="p1">From far away in the building, perhaps on an upper floor, there’s a clatter, as though of cookware hitting folding chairs. To me it sounds like nothing at all, but for him, it’s more than enough. “They’re coming,” he says, in that same flattened voice. He’s scooping the contents of the table into a backpack, and I briefly I get one last look at that brilliant golden orb.</p>
<p class="p1">“<i>Who’s</i> coming?” He doesn’t reply. “<i>Mbetethi!</i>”</p>
<p class="p1">I absolutely bungle the first consonant, and that’s what he responds to, snapping, zipping. “It’s just <i>Tethi.</i> Teth, if you like. <span class="s1">Better collect your things, because in a few seconds —”</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s3">[Mona resigns herself to leaving her voxelite prints behind here.]</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">There’s a <i>tink-tink-tink</i> as, above us, the lights go out. There’s a pneumatic <i>hiss</i> as, God, I dunno — the doors seal up? Behind me, Tethi rips down the curtain, and all I can see is an eye-level orange-red, dozens of pairs of Contecs bobbing in the dark. Muffled voices, shouting, more clash-clang-bang. The clamor that was so distant a minute ago is now a short distance away. I wouldn’t last a day here. “Evacuating in sixty seconds,” someone shouts, but my Mandarin must be doing <i>guangpan</i> barrel rolls because it’s the wrong<i> evacuate</i>, it’s the one that has to do with test chambers and pressure differentials. On the far end of the pitch-black space, an even pitcher blacker space opens up, damp and cold and somehow a little windy. I stumble over spools and stools, trying to keep up. <i>How does everyone know where they’re going?</i> Am I the only one without Contecs here?</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s <i>her!</i>” someone shouts this, a voice charged with amphetamines, and not the touchy-feely kind. Every hair on my body stands unit-normal jump-scare upright as I realize that its <span class="s1">owner</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s3">[The small, barking man]</span>, who I cannot see, must be pointing at <i>me</i>. “She led them right here! We oughtta leave her inside for them to find!”</p>
<p class="p1">A few interested pairs of Contecs turn my way, but Tethi grabs my shoulder. “<i>Shenjing bing</i>, paranoid freaks,” he snarls. “<i>Gun kai</i>. Fuck all the way off.” And then, now leading me around a floor covered in very physical debris, he growls, “It had better not be you.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Tethi. Teth. <i>What is going on?</i>”</p>
<p class="p1">“What do you think?” he whips back. And, hell, it’s a fair question. The clamor is close enough that I can pick out individual voices; I imagine a great <i>katamari</i> of riot armor and laser sights rolling our way.</p>
<p class="p1">“Evacuation in five,” the voice is nearby, as we straggle through what I reckon, proprioceptively, as a large door. “Four...three...”</p>
<p class="p1">“Listen to me. There are a lot of tunnels, but they all lead outside.”</p>
<p class="p1">“You’re not serious.” There’s a great <i>hiss</i> behind us and I raise my voice to a shout. “I don’t even have Contecs!”</p>
<p class="p1">Tethi is a pair of blinking orange circles. And then he’s nothing at all. “Don’t find me,” he warns. And he pushes sideways through a self-imposed darkness, through the damp and gathered human throng, and now he’s gone. The crowd is moving forward at an uncertain pace, but at its very rear I feel no tempo, no pressure, and I stumble forward too slow and too uncertain. With another layer of doors between us the clamor of voices is more muffled than before, but I can still make out one last thing as I round a bend: <i>“By order of the Weather Bureau, open up!”</i></p>
