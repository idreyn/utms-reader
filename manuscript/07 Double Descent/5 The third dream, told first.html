<p class="p1">This one is always through her eyes.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s how I remember it.</p>
<p class="p1">In this dream I’ve been out, all over the place, chasing Ripples.</p>
<p class="p1">Still peeling myself off the screens on the walls.</p>
<p class="p1">Still catching glimpses of myself through other eyes.</p>
<p class="p1">Blue-grey daybreak, early April.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">I have a bad feeling, coming home.</p>
<p class="p1">Maybe I shouldn’t have left her alone tonight.</p>
<p class="p1">But I had to go. It was important. <i>Why?</i></p>
<p class="p1">Maybe I shouldn’t have gotten her involved at all.</p>
<p class="p1">But she’s a natural. She was born to chase.</p>
<p class="p1">Rainboots on my feet, keycard in my hand, tired, <i>tired.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">I hope I find her curled up on the couch. Or in bed.</p>
<p class="p1">But such light rain can’t explain all the water in the lobby.</p>
<p class="p1">I take the stairs <i>(I never take the stairs!)</i></p>
<p class="p1">At each landing, I see it leaking from behind the doors.</p>
<p class="p1">Not her. Please, not her.</p>
<p class="p1">But I already know I’m too late.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The door opens inward, only this time it doesn’t.</p>
<p class="p1">I push and push until finally water rushes out.</p>
<p class="p1">Every tap in the flat is gushing water.</p>
<p class="p1">Nothing behind her eyes except my own words.</p>
<p class="p1"><i>The entire city is a great coral reef.</i></p>
<p class="p1">I fix her eyes. I scream her name.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>“Mona!”</i></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1">I blink, seeing my own face, seeing Cai Yuhui’s. And that’s when I remember who I am, where I am, what I’m doing. The water is up to my waist now. It was with such satisfaction, mere moments ago, that I kept it flowing, but now the rationale recedes with slick tentacularality into a vantablack hole in my mind. I don’t know whose thoughts those were. I don’t even know if you could <i>call</i> those thoughts, humming in harp-struck primary colors behind my eyes. I should have listened: I should never have looked, and especially not to impress my flatmate. Behind her, shouting, footfall, irridescent visors, vialguns. The Weather Bureau is already here.</p>
<p class="p1">Slowly, I take my hands off the tap, and put them in the air.</p>
