<p class="p2">“Mona,” she says, falling-falling. And I feel the spring-load of the moment, the outrush of months and months of coiled potential energy. But now, crushing devastation: in her eyes I see the same mechanism fail to fire. Nothing was leading up to this. She never wondered what this moment would be like. I am a problem to be solved. Yue Fang looks at me, then at her, and after trying to broker a pleasantry or two decides she really needs to file those drives.</p>
<p class="p2">Cai looks right into my clockwork and softly, but perceptibly, sighs. “Can I talk to you outside?”</p>
<p class="p2"><i>Outside</i> is a balcony ringing the dome of Building 6. Cai holds the door open for me, which I don’t like. But I don’t mind the preautumnal crispness up here, the cool breeze wafting over the Huangpu’s tesselatory chop. I squint; her Contecs go real reflective. “Why are you here?”</p>
<p class="p2">“It’s good to see you, too, Yuhui.”</p>
<p class="p2">“If it’s good to see me, <i>call.</i> Or pick up the phone. When I heard your voice in the hall just now, my heart dropped<i>.</i> After all this time, this is where you come to find me? What am I supposed to think?”</p>
<p class="p2">“This is where you work. This is —” And I gesture sharply at...<i>all</i> of her. Cai is a walking map of Ripplechasing culture from the top of her head downward. Oh, all tasteful, of course. Her hair is pure, shocking white. Those sigils are done in neuro-fade ink, probably wiped and remapped every six months. Her long, folded arms, her almost cranelike neck, are all ringed with minimalist strata, topaz and bone and — yep, go back far enough, coral. The Mirror Sea is Cai’s research and her hobby, her livelihood twice over. I always found it hard to see another layer of her that wasn’t just...this.</p>
<p class="p2">I think she takes that point only too well. “Don’t act like you’re here to see me. What’s on the drive?”</p>
<p class="p2">“What’s in the Mirror Sea?” I ask. Confusion blits over her Contecs. I press, now lightheaded, welcoming the thick of it: “No, I’m completely serious! Why is the entire Observatory holing up all of a sudden?”</p>
<p class="p2">“The ward —”</p>
<p class="p2">“The wards would tell you something. They’d be coming to you for answers.”</p>
<p class="p2">“The Ward Council,” she finishes flatly, “passed a flimsy paperwork barrier to keep <i>live feeds</i> out of the hands of teenagers. Who are coming from out-zone and getting a first exposure to loop-lock <i>and</i> DMT. Do you ever talk to the freshmen? Do you see that their realities are getting broken this week? If, on top of that, we’re promoting the Mirror Sea all over campus some of them are going to snap.” Snap like you did. “Of course we’re scaling back.”</p>
<p class="p2">Suddenly I don’t feel good, no, not at all. One moment I’m leaning on the balcony and the next I’m retching — dry-heaving, because what have even I eaten in the last day? And that becomes a loud, ugly sob, and then a train of silent ones, and then Cai has me in her arms. “I fucked up bad,” I choke out. “I went chasing last night...”</p>
<p class="p2">“Oh...”</p>
<p class="p2">”I didn’t mean to. I didn’t seek it out.” But didn’t I? Didn’t I skulk around for nights, hoping it would find me? And isn’t that exactly how it works — wait, <i>isn’t it?</i><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And now, I, I can’t tell what I saw in there...”</p>
<p class="p2">I am so, so embarassed by how readily I fell victim to quadratic belief. One night! My mind feels so slippery, like I have perfect leeway to <i>choose</i> to the truth, not just myself but for the world, and I slip-slide dangerously down the parabola, gaining a tiny bit of traction only in admitting what had happened. Pathetic! Cai lives her life night and day on the razor’s edge of delusion, and never a hair out of place, and me — and <i>me</i> —</p>
<p class="p2">I spend a few minutes blubbering something to this effect, and Cai strokes the back of my head.</p>
<p class="p2">“I wish I could be the one to help you, but you’re right, I’m inseperable from it. I’m a walking extension of the Mirror Sea.” Had I said that out loud? “And I’m to blame for what happened to you last year. I ought to have been more cautious bringing you in; I oughn’t have left you alone that night, and...” For a moment, Cai Yuhui’s entire apparatus of psychological dazzle camouflage falters. Something besides pure poise cracks into her voice, her posture, and in the candelabric flickering of her Contecs (this reminds me too much of the diving-bell, and I look away). I see a vessel with no lid, filled to the brim, trying with every careful motion not to spill. I cling to the idea that this glimpse under the skin, this dropped frame, was intentional; the next moment, it’s gone. “And I’m sorry.”</p>
<p class="p2">“Promise you won’t call the Weather Bureau on me?” This has the veneer of a joke, but God, the last thing I need is another two nights in custody, interchangeable men asking a battery of interchangeable questions, peering through the cracks in my sanity — in the worst moments, I recall, almost trying to pry them open...</p>
<p class="p2">“Mona Xu.” Cai puts a hand on each of my shoulders. “I am your friend, and even if I wasn’t, the last thing I would do is call the Weather Bureau on you. They’ll build a cage around every mind in the city if we let them. Maybe they’ll even find a way to take down every Mirror Sea display in the city. But they’ll never take down the cameras, because they’re the real freaks, the ones who really can’t let it go. They have nothing else. You do.”</p>
<p class="p2">Another frame drops; Cai looks faintly sad and very tired.</p>
