<p class="p1">Very nearly napping on a shady patch of the quad, I become distantly aware of a crowd forming nearby, of something businesslike unfolding, even of several vehicles crawling onto the sidewalks. A campus tour...no, a demonstration...an awards ceremony...a press conference? I let these possibilities float lazily past me, letting leafy spackles dancing through my eyelids explain them to me, preferring the simple heat of the sun to anything like <i>information</i> at this time, thank you very much. I turn towards it, unfurling myself to it, to the bees buzzing around me. I hear several voices at once in the crowd behind me repeating <i>sunflower, sunflower,</i> this word alone cresting above the chatter. Yes I am, thank you very much...</p>
<p class="p1">“— the so-called Sunflower Sieve —”</p>
<p class="p1">Knowing this is important to me, but too groggy to understand why, I peel myself off the ground and glare in the direction of the noise. Several news teams are on the ground, their lead engineers each huddled against a control panel, marshalling competing swarms of cameras, lights, and microphones around...who is that?...poor Dr. Guo. He keeps a level tone even as the studios flash eye-level questions in <i>shanzi.</i> His Mandarin is chewy; his caterpillar eyebrows track the contours of his prepared statement as though he’s reading it for the first time.</p>
<p class="p1">“— have not evaluated any claims of efficacy or safety —”</p>
<p class="p1">I dash to the clinic, already knowing what I’ll find. Three emails from different organs of YINS have already arrived, admonishing the students, faculty, and staff against using a powerful new neikotic egg that just landed online. How? Did Tethi drop the damn thing in the ruckus at Double Descent? Was it reverse-engineered by one of the quants using it? The basement hallway is so full that I can barely squeeze out of the elevator, full of neikonauts from every conceivable profession: Big Three traders and Blue Delta administrators, civil engineers and artists and computer scientists, YINS first-years huddled in horror along the wall. All of them stepping over each other to let me pass, their eyes feeling like hands, <span class="s1">that vantablack spikiness grasping...searching...for what?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span><span class="s3">[This should probably be a realization Mona has after she physically puts together the debris — maybe move to the next day?]</span>Yao finds me, claps me on the shoulder, brings me back to earth. “This is the big one,” he observes, with an affectedly calm, clinical air. “Printed you a copy of the thing.” He drops an egg into my hands, <i>the</i> egg, just like the one Tethi was lobbing like a baseball. Finally I get an up-close look at its radial, goldenrod jets, its beady black center. It was named well.</p>
<p class="p1">Instinctively I start twisting and prodding. “Is there a mechanism?”</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s one solid piece. Apparently something to do with the way light passes through it. All these folks have hatched it in the last few hours, so I imagine it’s pretty easy.” Yao goes onto explain what happened while I was, well, napping. At around six this morning (I was still out) a new post appeared in the legendary <i>Post Ur Eggs</i> thread of an even more legendary neikotics forum. Now, printing and pondering a random neikotic egg from the internet is about as prudent as slurping up the hexavalent sludge at the bottom of the Huangpu. Many of the eggs from this thread are the psychedelic equivalent of a jump scare or a picture of a prolapsed anus. Plenty of others just kill you instantly. But some traders suspected that <i>this</i> was the egg that their in-the-know colleagues had been using to run circles around them for the past week, and took the risk. It was internalized midmorning in Pudong’s trendy sludge bars and rope gyms, and by the afternoon, the Sunflower Sieve was the metagame on all the exchanges.</p>
<p class="p1">“...generalizable enough to have applications<i> </i>anywhere a spectral sieve does.” Yao is cheerfully pointing out all the specific kinds of neikonaut the Sieve has already immiserated with its debris. But my eyes are drawn again and again to the egg. It’s somewhere between transparent and translucent, doing something soft and inviting to light that I’ve never seen before, that I might have presumed unphysical. <i>How? How is this possible?</i> The question is the gate to the garden path, and the answer is, precisely, the algorithm that the egg contains.</p>
<p class="p1">“And just think, it’s your inversion that’s going to make it practical to use. They’re already talking about trying to build it into the Sunflower Sieve as a cleanup step.” Something dawns on Yao. “Hopefully before summer internships.”</p>
<p class="p1">There’s no time to ponder this before Dr. Rui steps out of a back room, cups his hands, and calmly shouts: “Those of you from Suowei Financial, Paracoin, or Chaoyue, please return to your employer to seek treatment! We’ve put the inversion online, and you have more beds than we do.” A few neikonauts stand to leave; others stow their badges.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Behind him, Dr. Deng is opening up an EASL array that appears to have melted a bit. She catches my eye and waves a screwdriver menacingly. “Go! Go and write your paper!”</p>
