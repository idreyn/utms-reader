<p class="p2">So I do. Or I try, anyway.</p>
<p class="p2"><i>Anything will do,</i> Dr. Rui told me. The idea is not to produce a fascinating, well-written, groundbreaking paper, but a stake in the ground. Years from now, neikologists will need to reference the Sunflower Sieve (as a seminal breakthrough? An antique oddity? It’s too soon to say). And there will be a standard paper that they all point their synthesizers at: one that’s succinct, points to other work on the topic, and preferrably, written by an authority on the subject. My goal is to write that paper, and to become that authority. My goal is not to overthink it, to put down in simple terms what I know and what I saw. My goal is to ignore this microfiber blanket and soft-glo desk lamp and giant thermos of tea — all things that, three hours ago, I insisted to myself that I needed in order to write — and stay awake in this chair.</p>
<p class="p2">The problem isn’t exactly a blank page. One of my monitors is opened the Soup, the neikotic open access archive, and every second brings twenty fresh papers about the Sunflower Sieve: its underpinnings, applications, variants, and sporadically, its dangers. Each paper is digested into a single twinkling point in a galactic three-dimensional space on my next monitor. I’ve been waving an axial controller like a mad witch, doodling contours around the stars. When the slalom of a particular line looks promising, seems to zig and zag around all the other papers in an intriguing way, I slap the render button, sip my still-scalding tea, and skim my new synthetic paper.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">These synthetics provide admirable summaries, but the actual synthesis tends to be a little gooey in the middle, and the figures are uniformly nonsensical. We print out and paste up all the silliest ones. That doesn’t stop anyone from setting up a script to fire thousands of synthetic papers into the Soup, and why should it? Some of the great guidestones of neikotic theory have bubbled out of it. Mueller’s Folding Lemma was a synthetic paper, an offhand mathematician’s footnote about choice of sign that had bounced blindly and abrasively off all the nonsense in the archive until its latent, gorgeous contours were clear. The computers are great at sifting these diamonds from the silt, and a synthetic paper that racks up a million or so citations is usually worth at least a glance by a human being.</p>
<p class="p2"><i>The frustrating challenge for today’s young scientist is to sculpt a grain of sand so dazzling that it makes the whole beach shine differently.</i> Guan Zhumi or some similar industry figure had said this at a Tomorrow Evening keynote a few years ago, with the undertone that it would be best to give up and become a PXY counterfactuals trader instead. And it’s hard to look at the encroaching wall of papers, crackling with static electricity, and not want to give up. Any original thought I could possibly<i> </i>have about the Sunflower Sieve has already been synthesized, discarded, and liquefied beneath further strata. But a signature by a YINS private key, an unsmudged human fingerprint, will be weighted highly by the synthesizers. If I write something insightful, it could bounce around in there for years.</p>
<p class="p2"><i>So write something insightful, you big dummy!</i></p>
<p class="p2">Instead I spin my chair so forcefully that I end up with a headache, which is just as likely to produce a groundbreaking paper as anything else I’ve been doing. Then, reluctantly slumping back towards the keyboard, I filter the malestrom of papers for <i>debris.</i> This has basically no effect<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— almost all Sieve papers have a throwaway line like, <i>further work is needed to mitigate the harmful effects of the neikotic debris produced by this algorithm.</i> But a few more tweaks give me a constellation of only those papers focused on the Sieve’s debris. A halfhearted circular flick gives me a summary, and the summary gives me both everything I could want to know about the debris — its Kasibar spectrum, its twelve-facet symptom profile, an oddly clinical retelling of recent days of my own life — and absolutely nothing at all.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p3">* * *</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">I hatch the egg. I’m out of practice, but it’s as straightforward as Yao predicted. The key to the way its amber mantle softens and bends light turns out to be a fibrous nest of tubules in the core, and their basic structure is the shadow of something more complicated that I know will unfold in loop-lock. Tethi gave his clients half an hour to hatch the thing in the darkness of Double Descent’s negative fourth floor. Had there been any real light in there, I bet they could have done it in five. So, trepidatiously, I bring the egg to the campus scanner center, and I bring the Sieve into loop-lock. I hold in the front of my mind, each eye three inches from a screen, forcing myself to hallucinate the secret patterns of the egg in the staticky shapes that the tiles form again and again andagainandaganagandanannnnnnnnnnnuntil finally I’m back there. <span class="s1">I don’t feel anything immediately, but as I grope and probe around the corners of my consciousness, the Sieve unfolds around me like something out of an optical illusion.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">At first the colorful space I occupy appears empty, but I begin to notice that certain shapes and figures I thought to be far in the distance are actually alarmingly close, and when I focus on moving them (for of course they are my own thoughts) I can see how they articulate. I peel the intricate machinery into the foreground, willing it to flex and bend, watching carefully how its pieces interact with each other, shocked at the size of the thing. Soon the ways it moves — and thus the ways <i>I </i>can move — become apparent, its stiffnesses and affordances already more familiar than those of the body in the scanner chair. If I had to describe it, and I guess I do, I would say I feel like an intricate, translucent, semirigid nest of millions of tubes ranging in size from the carotid to the capillary, like a pipe organ from the distant future. The bulk of my attention is not so much dedicated to the Sunflower Sieve as <i>is</i> the Sunflower Sieve; but beyond its boundaries there is enough of myself left over to admire it from all kinds of angles. Then I look for some shit to put in it.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">The funny thing about the Weather Bureau is that they really do still report the weather. From their servers I pull on gossamer feeds from millions of sensors — temperature, pressure, humidity, wind, sunlight — from Chongming to Suzhou. This is the rawest data I can find, terabytes of numbers free of context or cleaning, and I spool it into the Sieve, clogging its pipes, until I think I might burst. And as the Sieve churns, some of its pipes <i>do</i> burst. There’s no sound in loop-lock, not exactly, but it goes — ahem — <i>thoing!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i> Its overloaded arteries spill their partially digested contents into tilespace.<i> Thoing! Thoing! Thoing!</i> Most than half of the tubules snap and wither. Ninety percent. Ninety-nine. In ingesting a year of data, the Sieve has become a map, a model, a perfect and highly predictive little snowglobe that says exactly when it’s going to rain, its sparse and yet highly suggestive structure singing with probability amplitudes tinged with petrichor.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">It’s so good that you could almost forget that neikotic debris is spilling out of it by the megabyte.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">It’s so, <i>so</i> good, in fact, that it would be very easy to overlook the fact that this is its primary purpose.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">I leave the Sieve behind, paging it to disk, and follow the debris as it sinks into the lower eta band. The loops are slower down here, the tiles are darker. The debris is hard to spot: tiny, flaky distortions in tilespace, thousands of tiny jitters as I descend. <i>Focus. Oversample a single piece.</i> It’s barely ten tiles wide, quantized and comb-like, flitting rapidly. It collides with another piece. And another. The pieces clump, grabbing for each other, their eerily primitive snowflake-arms and cilia and corkscrews fitting together in a dazzling number of ways. The clumps become complex, noisy, dazzling chunks of tile, always grabbing, always reaching, flitting around with microscopic quickness. But as they reach a certain size, they converge towards that familiar coiling, meshing alphabet of shapes. Only now ten times larger...</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">I watch, astounded, as the fractal flakes of the Sieve’s debris reassemble themselves, sticky and motile and almost velcro-like, into the same patterns at ever-larger orders of magnitude. From this flurry, a single enormous piece of debris emerges. I dash and slosh around it, looking for good angles, watching the corkscrew-nautilus grab for another piece at its own macroscopic scale. But there aren’t enough flakes for another piece this big. It scintillates frustratedly in place, too fast for the garbage collector to have a chance, heavy enough to hurt.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">And it’s...reflective.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">It’s true. I can see myself in that outer layer of tiles, probing, grabbing. I have no <i>head</i> here, but as I approach, as I focus, I see the thickness of the surrounding flakes, the deep blue eta-band murk. </span>It occurs to me that, in loop-lock, things don't just <i>reflect</i> light. The reflection is something that has to be computed, ray-traced. It takes tiles, cycles, time and energy to do this. Why bother? I draw closer, expanding the surface of the debris across my awareness, trying to untangle the pattern. Am I losing myself in it, or seeing myself in it? The very question grabs me...</p>
<p class="p6">And then a memory of a truth: <i>you’re grabbing. YOU’RE holding on.</i></p>
<p class="p6">Which inflates into a command, a single adrenaline-soaked admonition: something between <i>let go</i> and <i>run</i>.</p>
<p class="p6">Which inflates into a cartwheeling flash-bang whiteness, a logical rectification too fast and pure and tight to pick apart, roaring from the center of my being, flaying apart the debris as it expands, shocking me out of loop-lock.</p>
<p class="p6"><i>Is this the inversion? Is it really that simple? Is that all that’s in the diving-bell?</i></p>
<p class="p6">The tiles flatten before my eyes, twinkling stereoscopic pixel-dust. I force myself upright, breaking the vague paralysis of loop-lock, ripping the tube from my wrist and spilling saline solution all over the scanner. My inner ear is off the clock, stumbling and nearly falling, my world ringing with birdsong made of bells made of birdsong, the tilespace gone but the trip far from over. But I need this halfway state — and though this is no way to go about it — I need to carry those interlockings, those fractal patterns, directly back into the waking world. I grasp for my pile of voxelite Sieve debris, letting my fingers choose the fragments, and with my other hand, I reach for a hot glue gun.</p>
<p class="p6">The shapes in my eyes match the shapes behind them.</p>
<p class="p6">Fragment by fragment, minute by minute, mind by mind, I begin to build.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p8">* * *</p>
<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p6">By the time I’m ready to fire a paper into the Soup at quarter to five in the morning, I can’t feel my face.</p>
<p class="p6">I’ve been into loop-lock at least six more times.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Several, to revist the logic by which the Sieve debris fits together, each time bringing a nugget back to soberspace for my hands and my hot glue gun. I never quite manage to make it all fit together, but I have assemblages of ten, fifteen, twenty voxelite fragments littering the desk.</p>
<p class="p6">Twice, to scour the Soup for existing literature on a class of neikotic debris that acts as a fractal construction kit for uncanny, skeletal self-similar structures. Someone would have mentioned this, right?</p>
<p class="p6">Once — I forget why I went in, and what I did in there. Maybe played some games.</p>
<p class="p6">Last, for heavy-duty text synthesis — a real passenger-seat experience, as neikotics goes. It felt like pipe cleaners exfoliating my brain’s language centers, like the computer taking a rubbing of my mind, and it was over before I knew it. With nothing but a chicken-scratch outline to work from, my loop-locked self produced a brief paper, my first ever paper: <i>Sunflower Sieve Debris As A Tilespace Basis</i>. If there was any moisture left in my body, I’d shed a tear. I pop another amphetamint and force myself to read it.</p>
<p class="p6">The prose is modern and terse, maybe a little heavy on the <i>shanzi</i>, but it brings me new clarity. A tilespace basis is a kit of tiny parts that can build any computing machine in loop-lock. There are no shortage to choose from, but most neikotics this side of the Pacific uses a standard eleven-piece basis (Deng’s favorite cocktail party topic is whittling this down to nine). The Sieve debris turns out to form a new basis that no one has ever seen...spontaneous self-assembly with no discernable purpose...with these inferred EMBRs...<i>see</i> <i>Wei et al. for the method used</i>...blah blah blah...</p>
<p class="p6">My own groundbreaking paper is putting me to sleep. The characters blur into thick nests of spiderweb and thyme by the end of the second page. I’m almost ready to just submit the damn thing and read it later when a throwaway footnote catches my eye. <i>We note —</i> it begins, and I curse myself for not turning off the ‘royal we’ flag.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><i>We note that the basis forms bear some subjective resemblance to the structures in the Mirror Sea which are known as hyperlagmites.</i></span><span class="s4"> </span><span class="s5">[What if Mona doesn’t read this footnotes until Tethi mentions it to her?]</span></p>
