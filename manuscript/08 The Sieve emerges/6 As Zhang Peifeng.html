<p class="p1">My groundbreaking paper survives two generations in the Soup before it’s outcompeted. Its genetic line ends before noon the next day, buried under more than a million new entries in the <i>Sunflower Sieve</i> subheading. The Soup bots have been busy rehashing and summarizing and synthesizing. The Sieve has long escaped the financial world, and no matter who aims it at their work — astronomers, algorithmers, archaeologists — it reveals simplicity from complexity. So who cares about its waste product? Six thousand bots and two humans reviewed <i>Sunflower Sieve Debris As A Tilespace Basis </i>while I was in a deep and dreamless sleep. They marked as spam, as a duplicate, as quackery — and despite the care I took to blur images of debris — as a neikohazard. As a result, my account is temporarily banned from publishing to the Soup.</p>
<p class="p1">Well, not <i>my</i> account. You didn’t think I published under my own name, did you?</p>
<p class="p1">Nobody in their right mind claims a paper before it’s clear that it will survive the Soup. What you do is create a new key pair for each paper, keep the private half in your back pocket, and only reveal that you hold it after the paper is scrutinized and corellated and cited. To do otherwise would needlessly dilute your impact factor. You would run the risk of being publicly wrong, or worse, publicly boring. And hey! People used to keep the hoard of their research for themselves, keeping all kind of decent stuff in poorly named folders on lab servers, in the name of a coherent CV. With the advent of PK-fishing, nothing goes to waste. You can tell when a YINS researcher is getting ready to drop a PK — from the way they float around campus on a cloud no one else can see, and from they way they’re constantly muttering seed phrases to themselves.</p>
<p class="p1">So, ahem, Zhang Peifeng has been banned from the Soup. But Zhang Peifeng is just a random name from the PK generator, and I can try again tomorrow, or in a few hours, or whenever I have the energy to get out of bed. For now, I’m happy enough to eat ice cream, sweat out the drugs, and watch coverage of the Sunflower Sieve on YZTV Finance. For about six hours, Shanghai had the financial firepower to reverse the peg between the yuan and the ping, briefly leading in its tense financial dance with Beijing. Commentators argued about how to use this leverage: <i>Full independence!</i> <i>No, full reunification!</i> They all wore Blue Delta pins, and I think one guy changed sides as I drifted in and out of sleep. But now the rest of the world has figured out the Sieve, and the markets have equilibrated. YTZV is running out of material, and just now they’re replaying the clip of Dr. Guo urging caution on the YINS quad. You can see me napping in the background.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">* * *</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p1">I consider submitting again. I consider what I should eat.</p>
<p class="p1">But as afternoon fades, a message appears, addressed to “Zhang Peifeng” on the Soup.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p5"><i>Dr. Zhang,</i></p>
<p class="p5"><i>This morning I had the opportunity to read your paper, “Sunflower Sieve Debris As A Tilespace Basis”. In response to your comment in Footnote 19, I have something to show you that I believe you may find interesting. I consider this a potential avenue for collaboration. Are you able to meet in person?</i></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1">The message is unsigned, except with a public key. <i>Footnote 19?</i> Have I even read all the footnotes? I flip back to the PDF of my paper, scanning the tiny print at the bottom of each page. The nineteenth footnote is wedged between a caveat on eta-band neikography and a dense partial differential equation. <i>We note — </i>it begins, and I curse myself for not turning off the ‘royal we’ flag before synthesis —</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p5">(19) We note that the basis forms bear some subjective resemblance to the structures in the Mirror Sea which are known as hyperlagmites.</p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1">I had known. I had pushed it to the very, very back of my mind, trying to keep the Sea at bay, trying to do one productive thing as a researcher before its tide of parabolic delusion swallows me whole. And yet it was dredged from the recesses of my subconscious, from the place where things go when I’m <i>not thinking about</i> them. And now...and now what? Fingers trembling, I tap out a response:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><i>I can meet tonight. Pick a public place.</i></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p1">I’m not trying to, you know, die.</p>
