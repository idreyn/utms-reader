<p class="p2">This is how I find myself on the metro to Zhabei, a narrow canal-facing<i> </i>strip of a ward dangling lackadasially off Hongkou West. I spend the entire ride over trying frantically to exchange some CWL for ZHB. Dongtanglu’s exit fare spends nice because there’s always someone, visiting scholars or what have you, who needs to get to YINS. But Dongtanglu voted to fast-track Blue Delta’s annual fumbling ward unification proposal in the Ward Council, and Zhabei is retaliating by sanctioning the exchange of its token. I have to put together a package of fractionalized HKS, TAN, and LDZ before the exchange will even let me bid on ZHB. And by the time I get there, its countervalue in ever other token has skyrocketed. Its fare gates are broken, and the ward’s redlights are letting everyone through. God dammit.</p>
<p class="p2">Zhabei Ward wears a nondescript, turn-of-the-century faux-brass sheen with weary pride. It insists on itself, as so many of residential wards do, as a normal place for normal people to live, away from all...<i>that</i>. The city up here is so many towers in so many parks, wide avenues and trickles of mopeds. No shortage of Mirror Sea cameras, but no grand meters-long displays: just peeks from the windows of FamilyMarts and sushi shops, on dingy monitors next to their own CCTV streams. No parades of young people covered in feathers or gemstones or boa constrictor skins. No skulking around in our sewers. Go away.</p>
<p class="p2">On the whole I feel good about not being kidnapped, even after circling through a brightly-lit shopping center and realizing that our rendezvous is out the back, in a narrow alleyway arcade, cerulean tile walls and grimy glass archways. The public safety checkpoint is a converted cell phone shop, and the redlights <i>are</i> all on their phones. But a daycare is guarded by an inflatable pig, and the laoban of a fishmart gives me a look like <i>I will defend you with this broom. </i>Between these is Min’s Miscellaneous Electronics, and this is the spot. I order some fish balls — why wait hungry? — and eat them with the slow, dignified air of someone named Dr. Zhang Peifeng.</p>
<p class="p2">Soon the balls are gone, and no one has appeared. No one else lingers in this little cluster of tables, and the evening shoppers are thinning out. I glance back into Min’s Misc. Were we supposed to meet <i>inside</i>?</p>
<p class="p2">WELCOME! 24 BIT COLOR/240HZ REFRESH! SHOP WINDOWS FOOD TRUCKS AND MORE...<i>Min Shi Za Huo</i>’s front window are covered with QLED tickers, all advertising themselves. The door chimes Infrasong as I enter, the hairs standing up on my neck. It’s dim halogen, floor to ceiling pegboard shelving, and maybe <i>miscellaneous</i> is an understatement. Blenders and water heaters are stocked between factory-reject TPU arrays and stadium-grade quasigram projectors. A row of plastic tubs brims with voxelite pilfered from the city’s trading floors, three eggs for twenty ping. But a familiar irridescence draws my eye, and then my whole self, to the glass display case in the back.</p>
<p class="p2">The shopkeeper reserved all their care for these smoothly metallic teardrops, two dozen total, each in its own foam-lined case. I never noticed from ground level how much they vary in shape. But they’re all the size of a hand fruit, with the same basic structure. The tapered side has an inlet for CAT-5. The bulbous end hides the lens, of course, behind mirrored coating. It’s stamped with the blind-eye sigil that has become synonymous with Shanghai. <i>Do your thing,</i> it suggests. <i>I’m not watching. Not really.</i></p>
<p class="p2">“Get a load of the serial numbers,” suggests a low, soft voice, emerging from the back through thick plastic drapes. The laoban is a woman just past the crest of middle age, with small features, thin lips, and a pleasant crinkle around the eye. Her hair is buzzed perfunctorily short, in the style of the neikonaut cadets from decades past. She looks a little dusty. “Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-five-seven-nine,” she reads fondly off the leftmost Mirror Sea camera. “This is a prototype from the the Century Park pilot. But, count the digits — they had ambitions.”</p>
<p class="p2">Despite myself, despite my purpose here, despite everything, I ask: “Can I hold it?”</p>
<p class="p2">I expect her to laugh me off, but she nods solemnly and fetches a pair of microfiber gloves for each of us. “They had a real problem with fingerprints at first. The hash is sensitive to patterns like that — careful, <i>careful,</i>” she mutters, placing it into my hands. It has real heft, maybe double what I expected. “Here, take the front and give it a twist.”</p>
<p class="p2">I do, gingerly, feeling three tiny clicks and a satisfying counterclockwise <i>whir</i>. Then, from a seam unseen, the hemispherical cap falls into my hand. There’s a milky-quartz dragonfly eye behind it, or that’s how it looks, hundreds of nearly opaque facets that let light play through them only along intricate, rainbow-flecked micrometer grooves. An optical implementation of the Lam-Waldmann hash, carved by laser into real quartz. For the architects of the Mirror Sea, there could be no second-guessing the anonymizing properties of their surveillance system. A conventional lens, with the hash running in software behind it, would never win the public’s trust.</p>
<p class="p2">She clips a CAT-5 cable into the camera and it beeps once. “Now look.”</p>
<p class="p2">I gasp softly when I see the image that appears on the screen behind the counter. It’s like...like I’m looking into a cavern of jagged crystal formations, and seeing just faint hints of Min’s Misc. reflected not just in the color and texture of the facets, but their geometry too. I would say it’s kaleidoscopic, but there’s a way in which it’s precisely not: while a kaleidoscope is sensitive to tiny movements, the Lam-Waldmann Hash of the store’s interior barely changes as I swing the camera around. I point the lens at the shopkeeper; she raises an eyebrow, but appears only as a dark, wavy bloom on the peaks of larger formations.</p>
<p class="p2">The woman, who must be Min, gestures for the camera back. “I’ll part with it for twenty thousand ping.” She smiles at my nervous laughter. “But not lightly, and not for a stranger. I reckon it serves me better as a conversation piece, anyway. So what can I really do for you?”</p>
<p class="p2">“I’m...uh...I’m Zhang Peifeng.”</p>
<p class="p2">She blinks politely back, and then slowly offers her hand.</p>
<p class="p2">“I mean, I’m not really Zhang Peifeng. It’s a name I picked —”</p>
<p class="p2">“Oh. <i>Ohh</i>.” She smiles knowingly, turns, and shouts into the back room. “Teth!”</p>
<p class="p2">And a familiar face peeks through the plastic drapes. As happy to see me as ever.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p3">* * *</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p2">The back room is where it <i>really</i> gets miscellaneous. We pick our way through cardboard boxes of feather boas, lewd and faded DVD cases, and carefully sorted crates of neikotic refuse: <i>Optical-Rubidium Adapters (broken)</i>; <i>Phased array drivers (fixable)</i>; <i>USB cables (2.0).</i> In the back of the back is a kitchenette: a minifridge and a little burner and a wooden table. There’s a bottle of baijiu and a little glass on the table. Tethi’s been drinking. He lobs another little glass at me. “I should have known.” He looks at me up and down, at first a little coldly. But this breaks down into a chuckle. He points the fat end of the bottle at me appreciatively. “After the other night I really did suspect you were Weather Bureau. But you and I are on the same wavelength. Maybe the only two.”</p>
<p class="p5">“So someone leaked —” I begin, bursting with curiosity about the Sieve.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span>[This probably deserves more discussion. Does Mona think there’s any chance that Tethi leaked it?]<span class="s2">“Drink,” he insists, fending off my shop talk. “Tell me something about yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="p2">“Well, I study —”</p>
<p class="p2">“Anything but that. Drink.” He fills my little glass again and I drain it. “American, yeah?”</p>
<p class="p2">“California. San Francisco.” The liquor singes my nostrils. “Los Angeles off and on.”</p>
<p class="p2">“<i>San Francisco,</i>” he says in a spooky, vampiric tone, as though I’d said <i>Transylvania</i>. “So you came to chase Ripples?”</p>
<p class="p2">“I left Stanford to come to YINS. I studied —”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">Tethi sighs and gestures for my glass.</p>
<p class="p2">We cover a little more ground on my life. Very little on his. When I say, <i>My advisor, Dr. Deng,</i> he reaches for the bottle a sixth time, but stops short. Now, apparently, it’s time to talk shop. He wants to know everything I know about the Deng Bridge (not much). He wants to know why Deng denounced it (I repeat her words on the matter, but not Rui’s). Where I found it (in a closet). How it stabilizes the diving-bell (beats the fuck outta me). Who I used it on first —</p>
<p class="p2">“So, what, you work here?” I cut him off, flushed and a little tipsy. Eager to turn the game around.</p>
<p class="p2">He looks a little sniffy. “We’re in business together —”</p>
<p class="p2">“Drink.” I tap the bottle.</p>
<p class="p2">Tethi give me a languid smile and tips back his glass. But he doesn’t let me refill it.</p>
<p class="p2">“Here is what you need to know about me, Mona Xu. You have what I want. Studying under one of the great neikotic theorists of our time. Me, my hardware, all this — I’ve got four or five years to get out before it kills me.” He’s right, too. There’s an old Huandao scanner bed in the far corner of the storeroom — that model was recalled, piece-by-piece, almost ten years ago.</p>
<p class="p2">But something occurs to me. “You wanted ten thousand ping to show me that egg. Where’s that going?”</p>
<p class="p2">“Loans,” he answers briefly. “Home. Other such places. Mostly, the thing I intend to show you. But only if you agree, up front, that we will collaborate on a paper. Not many people are brave enough to mention the hyperlagmites — even the Mirror Sea — in a neikotics paper like that. Not even in a footnote. The Weather Bureau put its foot right through yours, and now it’ll be on the lookout for anything similar in the Soup.”</p>
<p class="p2"><i>Fuck!</i> I don’t have the heart to tell him that the footnote was unintentional.</p>
<p class="p2">“Then they’ll suppress whatever you and I write, no?”</p>
<p class="p2">“Well, they can’t remove it.” The Soup, for better or worse, is append-only. Once something is in there, it’s there forever. “They can vote it down, flag it, whatever. But we’re gonna sign it with our real PKs. Your <i>real</i> PK, proving that you’re a human being at YINS, studying under Deng Jinghan. Couldn’t ask for a more credible collaborator.”</p>
<p class="p2">He drums his fingers on the table, waiting for my answer. My breath is going shallow.</p>
<p class="p2">“You want me to help you take down the Weather Bureau?”</p>
<p class="p2">He laughs and shakes his head, a little sloshily. “God, no. On honest, I couldn’t care less what happens to them. I want you to help get me into YINS. I want my name on a paper they can’t ignore. Being honest, I think it could be good for your career, too.” He extends his hand. “What do you think?”</p>
<p class="p2">“You won’t even tell me what it <i>is</i>!”</p>
<p class="p2">“Ah. But you must have some idea.”</p>
<p class="p2">And, deep down, I do. And just about that deep down, I <i>need</i> to know. I need to see for myself. I <i>neeeeed</i> —</p>
<p class="p2">I catch myself not <i>not thinking about it</i>. Steady. If I’m going to work with the Mirror Sea as a neikonaut, I can’t be letting my mind slip-slide this way. So I hold it at a specific distance, look a little ways past it, <i>keeping it in its frame</i>, as Cai always said. It occurs to me that maybe after this, I won’t have to avoid her...</p>
<p class="p2">I extend my hand, and Tethi pulls his back a little ways. “And I want to be first author,” he decides, cheerily.</p>
<p class="p2">I roll my eyes. He grins. We shake on it.</p>
