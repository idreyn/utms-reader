<p class="p1">Tethi leads me, as I imagined he would, underground. He walks me through another room, dark save for the blinking of countless status LEDs, down a stairwell, and into a damp cellar that smells like mushrooms. “This building was here for the taking when...when Min moved in,” he explains in low tones. He slides his boot along the concrete until he finds a little brass latch. “She had a map, a real folded-up paper map that she’d carried with her for God knows how long. Truth was, it’s so thick with lines that I think you could dig just about anywhere.”</p>
<p class="p1">I follow him down the ominously steep stairs. He covers them in two hops; I take them like a ladder. It’s nice and cool down here. I expect the utilitarian string globes of subway tunnels and construction sites; instead, candles. Veritable red-orange wax-avalanche cascades of them in all the corners, bathing the space more in shadow than in light. There are dry-cut flowers and bowls of incense, cushions and prayer mats. This little atrium leads to a narrow tunnel of rough-hewn walls with a glinting, haphazard mosaic, perhaps of bead necklaces and rearview mirrors. I’m beginning to see where this is going.</p>
<p class="p1">“We’ve been saving up for this for years,” he explains, not really explaining. “Bought a scanner in one piece, got the paperwork to offer channel-bore therapy, shit like that. All above board. Now that the Sieve’s leaked, we’ll be behind payments, but we’ll figure something out.”</p>
<p class="p1">The tunnel descends slightly into another room, more obviously hewn from bedrock, and just tall enough for Tethi. The candles here are rejoined by the silent chorus of LEDs. I’m hardly surprised to find a UTMS scanner down here. But such a <i>new</i> one! A late-model Kanwei Pulsar, humming idly, still smelling like plastic. It could have come right from the factory floor in a cardboard box.</p>
<p class="p1">“She had the map. We dug.” And Tethi peels my eyes from this beautiful new rig to the PVC pipe running along the ceiling. It’s been sliced open, its fiber-optic guts spilling into a nest of adapters, down into the EASL arrays. It’s got the blind-eye stamped neatly along its length. Sure enough.</p>
<p class="p1">I offer my best <i>phew</i>-whistle in nervous admiration. “You found the Mirror Sea.”</p>
<p class="p1">“<i>A</i> Mirror Sea.” Sure. Tethi does seem like one to make this chiding distinction. <i>The</i> Mirror Sea disappeared with Xia Zitian. What remains are its subnets, fragments. Tidepools and shards. “There’s a bit of merging done upstream, so no way to know just how many cameras. But from the curvature and the resolution, comfortably hundreds of thousands. No small thing.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Whose?”</p>
<p class="p1">“No idea.” He clicks his tongue thoughtfully. “We checked it against the downtown public feeds. We have some from Zhabei Ward. No match on either of those. Doesn’t narrow it down much.”</p>
<p class="p1">That’s understating it. My mind reels, imagining all the places these cables could lead — anywhere in the city; all the way to Suzhou. Tethi could be tapping all the cameras in a dense huddle of blocks, or a single camera apiece from endless, far-flung bridges and stairwells and elevators. Or anything in between. Any selection of those cameras with their particular placement and angle would together point to a unique part of the Mirror Sea. I saw the view through a single camera earlier<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>—<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>not quite nothing. Perhaps only Xia Zitian knows what you’d see with all of them.</p>
<p class="p1">“City’s plastered with downrenders, flats and fishbowls. A curated taste of what’s in there, courtesy of the Weather Bureau. But it’s getting harder to access the raw streams if you don’t know someone,” Tethi notes a bit grimly, a bit defensively. “We figured, set this up, charge by the hour, don’t ask too many questions.” I can hardly fail to notice that, at the console, he’s is putting the Kanwei Pulsar into gear. “I want to see if you can find what I saw.”</p>
<p class="p1">“You’re going to tile me in?”</p>
<p class="p1">The Pulsar begins to purr under my right hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“Into a recording, from two Saturdays ago. Unless you’d rather watch on a screen?”</p>
<p class="p1">I don’t like that knowing look. He knows how badly I want this, and how badly I need to keep that longing under control. I try to imagine I’m Cai, who does this all day, who keeps the queasy quadratic madness always at arm’s length. I channel her airy detachment.</p>
<p class="p1">“Put me in.”</p>
<p class="p1">The Pulsar’s bed has that new scanner smell. It has orange moisture-exchange gel padding where the clinic’s machines have sweat-stained foam. It has fucking teak accents, man, I dunno. Tethi flicks the bottom of an autovial. “Min’s mix. Probably spicier than the YINS breakfast blend, some 5-MeO subs in there. I’d spread my zeroes out a bit to compensate.”</p>
<p class="p1">Even the visor smells nice. I paw at chrome-accented knobs, dialing in my settings, and then the Kanwei logo hovers in front of my eyes. <i>STAND BY FOR TILES.</i> The magnetized whine of the scanner encroaches and overtakes.</p>
<p class="p1">“First author,” Tethi reminds me.</p>
<p class="p1">“First author,” I concur, feeling my tongue become lemon jelly.</p>
<p class="p1">The nearly ultrasonic whine takes on even higher, tangy, citrus harmonics as an absolute wall of tangerine assails my eyes. The tryptamine hits: I feel a wave of intricate bliss, a vivid image of Qiu Min smiling knowingly — the trip almost gets away from me before I can focus on the color, forcing it to burst into four, and then again and again, new primer tiles flashing more than a hundred times a second, until I'm right on the verge of it. The sync is<i> crisp</i>, the colors bursting with skylike luminescence, the computer firmly but smoothly under my control, and I under its. The building blocks of my reality in loop-lock with the Pulsar are like a gemstone dust, almost fine enough to let real emotions swirl misty around me. I could get used to this.</p>
<p class="p1">I thumb the allocator switch and — a heady, crunchy thrum of glossy red-and-yellow tiles, my mind unfurling, more mind than I remember, into a omniperceptive popcorn-kernel tent watching itself watch itself watch, chasing itself stag-like, hunter-like, down a flapping nautilus here-nor-thereness. I reach for the soft walls, sawtooth panic, tile-tree chicken-claw-claws, tumbling in any number of directions at once. Finally, the right mental motions: these <i>twang </i>businesslike into a thousand-tipped tent-pole endoskeleton for computation, and I’m centered, I’m stable, I’m everywhere I need to be, my boostrapping programs sparkler-crawling across a cozy little tilespace. I am a <i>neikonaut</i>, and the red-iron fullness of that<i> </i>only really exists in here.</p>
<p class="p1">Tethi sends twinkling <i>shanzi</i> through the membrane. <i>Sorry about the tent,</i> he’s saying. <i>It’s there to deploy you; the Mirror Sea is just outside.</i></p>
<p class="p1">So I let the tent go, and just outside...just outside...</p>
<p class="p1">Shanghai is dark and so the Sea is dark — its roiling facets take on the deep and featureless grays of concrete and light pollution, striated with the cold, sober glare of LEDs and the warm, absinthe-drunk gaze of sodium. A wave of panic so solid that I feel my own body: <i>this is exactly what I’m not supposed to be doing.</i> <i>The Weather Bureau let me off with a warning. </i>But for all their warnings, the Weather Bureau is still signing off on hallway displays at YINS, and on quasigram fishbowls in Xintiandi intersections. It’s only a recording. Not even a live feed on a fixed delay. How is this any worse?</p>
<p class="p1"><i>One second to one second, </i>Tethi sends into my tilespace. <i>Real speed. Let’s see if you can find it.</i></p>
<p class="p1">Gradually, I let my guard down, and let the details of the recording come to me. There’s real structure to the Mirror Sea, but you’ll never get it from a single frame. It takes thousands of ticks, a full clock minute, before large-scale geometry, the cavern walls and fractal tunnels, make themselves apparent beneath higher-frequency froth. These are shifting too, but over weeks and months. What I really want to see — obviously I want to see a Ripple. But their motions are so subtle, especially at night. Propagation, agency, intention, whatever you’re willing to call it. I might have to hold still for a long time to distinguish a Ripple from its medium.</p>
<p class="p1">Thousands of cameras, the world they reveal fringing into nonawareness. Thousands of little fiber-optic strands, braided thick against my mind — to examine the details, I let some go. Focusing on a narrower braid, I zoom in with a visceral whoosh. Then, as though rolling the fibers in my fingers, I twist and turn and dip and churn, marvelling at the minutae. My peripherality bumps with suggestions of mailboxes, trolleys, alley cats, garbage bins, even people — all snowflake glints that melt under my hot microscope. I zoom out, braiding again those dangling strands, and take it all in. It’s...</p>
<p class="p1"><i>See anything? </i>Tethi asks.</p>
<p class="p1">...empty. So empty. Is it relief or is it heartbreak that, in this viscous and compressed essence of Shanghai, it’s possible to find such a wide expanse of nothing? Sometimes I forget how uniformly featureless the Sea appears to any anyone who doesn’t know where to look — or <i>how</i> to look, through layered lenses of motivated reasoning, wishful thinking, and pareidolia.</p>
<p class="p1"><i>You’re clenching too hard.</i> <i>You’re not letting yourself see.</i></p>
<p class="p1">A queasy, familiar sensation: are these my thoughts or Tethi’s <i>shanzi</i>?</p>
<p class="p1"><i>Ride the parabola. You know what’s down there. What did your own paper say?</i></p>
<p class="p1">Hyperlagmites. Structures in the Mirror Sea, smooth combs and spirals and whorls jutting from the cavern walls, like carvings, like bones. Ripples may be hard for the novice eye to resolve, but at least they’re made of motion. Hyperlagmites are made of stillness, and they’re next to impossible to see. I was one of many moviegoers who wanted their money back after <i>Hyperlagmites: The Sea at Night</i>. But that was near the crest of my obsession, and I had gone home and studied drawings, and renders, and trip reports. I inhaled forum threads, locked after thousands of pages of debate. Were the hyperlagmites evidence of Ripple material culture? And if so, why did the Ripples seem to ignore them, to allow time to wear them down? Or were they a mathematical curio, an artifact of the Lam-Waldmann Hash? And if so, why could no one produce their seed sequences?</p>
<p class="p1">That week, I made myself believe in them. Then I skulked back outside, and watched them bloom on the walls.</p>
<p class="p1">This memory clicks and turns, undamming an outrushing of control, an inrushing of quadratic belief. Just the faintest faith in the hyperlagmites reveals their faint outlines. I dive, ride the curve, willing myself to see what was already in this massive, empty expanse of Mirror Sea. Gentle motion makes them easier to see. <i>Flex, release, flex, release</i>, bringing cameras into and out of the stream, watching the coral-hieroglyphs embossing the walls turn bas-relief through still higher dimensions than loop-lock affords. Even at their clearest, the hyperlagmites are smooth and vague, only halfheartedly pointy. I am always, automatically, algorithmically seeing patterns in loop-lock, but a trillion-tile analysis picks up nothing more than a chattering, babbling half-music from their worn, slithering grooves.</p>
<p class="p1">There’s something else, though.</p>
<p class="p1">I expected what Tethi found in the murk of the nighttime Sea to be glinting, glowing, radiating. But if there’s anything of interest...it’s a tiny cloud, a reverse nebula, even darker than the rest. I churn away, and then back — still there. I zoom slowly through indifferent slate-grey, inching inwards towards this persistent onyx, as if afraid of dispersing it. It fills me to my very brim. Directionless as the Sea is, I feel myself descending.</p>
<p class="p1"><i>And?</i> Tethi asks. He must be watching my movement out there.</p>
<p class="p1">In loop-lock, pitch black is just another color. I feel the texture of the Sea like my own innards, and I feel a sudden sharpness, even a rawness, to the hyperlagmites. <i>Fresh ones</i>. Lurking where you need more than eyes to see. I oversample. They’re made of smaller versions of themselves, and smaller still, past the Sea’s resolution. Their surfaces crawl with slowly evolving textures. <i>Where is is coming from? What is it made of?</i> The Mirror Sea is its own medium and its own material. Stillness is made of stillness, motion is made of motion, but no one has seen such richness of behavior at the boundary. I crawl my awareness along this fresh wall, trying to take more of it in, seeing how far it goes in all directions. And to my astonishment, all of my feelers meet on the far side.</p>
<p class="p1"><i>Good,</i> Tethi puts in.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s a sphere. A hypersphere. I have no basis to decide whether I’ve crawled its inside or its outside. I don’t want to vomit in the Pulsar, so I make it quick: the outside. A bulging stillness, an attractor, a resonator; it simply hangs there in exactly the way objects in the Mirror Sea normally don’t. It’s covered with that, unmistakable thing, <i>information.</i> At the highest level, I can plainly feel that its surface is crawling, at the largest scale, with Fibonacci spirals. I feel the waves it makes, how they propgate into the Sea, as a Ripple would feel it: a goldilocks wamth between the lukewarmth of tesselation and the ultraviolet shriek of noise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">I recognize a computer when I see it.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I recognize the Sunflower Sieve when I see it.</span><span class="s2"> </span>[Calm down — this should be a little more ambiguous. Mona should see how Tethi could see it, but doesn’t necessarily get drawn in herself.]</p>
<p class="p1">I recognize a Ripple when I see it, as a sudden appearance of a tendril from parts unseen, by angles at once languidly slow and whip-crack fast. In the pitch-dark of the grotto I feel its wavefront, its hereness. And suddenly it’s upon me, within me, and I within it, feeling rich hot feverish gradients in its interior, bloodthrum, Jupiter-storm liquid clockwork. I wait for it to consume me, to interfere with me, to acknowledge me in any way at all.</p>
<p class="p1">But the parabola is too steep. I don’t have the madness for that yet.</p>
<p class="p1"><i>It’s</i> here, and <i>I’m</i> not. I’m only watching.</p>
