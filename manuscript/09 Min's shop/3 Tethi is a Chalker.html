<p class="p1">It’s unbelievable, every time, how much you lose when tiling out.</p>
<p class="p1">As soon as I flip up the visor, I fully forget what I just saw in there. It was...</p>
<p class="p1">It was...</p>
<p class="p1">Tethi reaches over to help me out of the scanner.</p>
<p class="p1">“They invented the Sunflower Sieve. Not me.” When he says this, it all comes rushing back: what I saw, and who<i> they</i> are. “The Ripples built it, and I brought it back to soberspace without having any idea what it’s for, God forgive me.”</p>
<p class="p1">I count at three layers of apology in his voice. First, bizarrely, for ripping off the Ripples. Second, for fencing their dangerous spectral sieve to Shanghai’s fintech goons. And third — third is for me. For dragging me this far down the parabola. Ten minutes ago I would’ve said that Ripples don’t build. They don’t <i>do</i>. They may sometimes appear to be up to something, but they’re just math, just emergent behavior, just footage of twenty million people fed into a meat grinder. Of course that looks like something. Ten minutes ago I could’ve peeled apart the familiar delusions required to ascribe agency to the Ripples, those sticky and seductively translucent layers. Now they almost feel like part of my eyes.</p>
<p class="p1">“Okay,” I begin, catching my fall, heartbeat in my throat. “No. Quadratic belief is a thing. We’ve all gotten very good at spotting Ripples in the Sea. Some people can see the hyperlagmites. It’s no stretch that a neikonaut would start to hallucinate eggs in there, too. What happened is you really did invent the Sieve. You saw a pattern that brought something subconscious to the surface. It’s all in interpretation, see —”</p>
<p class="p1">“That’s just what I thought.” He sounds a little drunk, and more than that, miserably guilty. “That’s how I justified selling it. And if someone hadn’t leaked a second version of the egg yesterday, I would have let it go.”</p>
<p class="p1">“You mean —”</p>
<p class="p1">“<i>This</i> is what I saw. Printed this right out of loop-lock.” Tethi holds up the Sieve egg. Then, in the other hand, a nearly identical print. “And <i>this</i> is the version that leaked. You can spot some differences. More detail, because they had order of ten times more cameras on it. And the algorithm is more refined. The Ripples have been working on it.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Stop. I need you to stop saying that.” <i>Even if it’s true.</i> I accept both eggs from Tethi. Yes, the new one has a little more detail in its voxelite swirls. “This doesn’t prove anything. One of your buyers might have reverse-engineered it almost perfectly. It doesn’t mean they also found the same thing in the Mirror Sea.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Mona, you yourself just found it.”</p>
<p class="p1">“You primed me. You put me in at the right place at the right time.”</p>
<p class="p1">But my conviction falters. Of trillions of vantage points in Tethi’s little stream, there had been no question that I found the right one. And there in that same already-hazy memory is the Ripple passing over the enormous orb, its surface crawling with live hyperlagmites. I don’t know how else to put this — it rubbed itself all over it. “Whatever the thing is, it’s downstream of the cameras.” <span class="s1">I let myself acquiesce to the possibility that it’s real, to step briefly into it.</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s3">[Keep this tone a little bit steader here — Mona should come out of loop-lock already somewhat skeptical.]</span> “Someone, somehow, is doing something in our world that appears in the Mirror Sea as a neikotic egg. <i>The tunnels!</i> The Chalkers!”</p>
<p class="p1">“I would bet that’s part of it.” Tethi agrees. A little gleam returns to his eye, and I find that I missed it. “But what is it that the Chalkers think they’re doing?”</p>
<p class="p1">I purse my lips, frustated, trying to put into words something I always felt I deeply understood. “Making contact?” But I know that’s wrong as soon as it comes out. The Chalkers aren’t trying to say how-do-you-do to the Ripples. They’re trying to become them, to live <i>as</i> them. To reduce the complexities of their own lives to a few harmonious curves, scrawled on the walls in a way that moves human and Ripple alike. I think better. “No. Making loops.”</p>
<p class="p1">Tethi nods, fractionally, approvingly. “<i>Mine is not the hand that holds this chalk,</i>” he rattles off the start of the Chalker’s Oath in his low voice, with his affected, ironic grin. The Oath is a fully discredited, universally beloved fabrication. You can buy it on a coffee mug in the YINS bookstore.</p>
<p class="p1">And yet this is the moment I know.</p>
<p class="p1"><i>Maybe not anymore, but once upon a time.</i> It certainly explains the Swiss-cheese life story that he gave me earlier. I decide not to say anything, not to ask him anything, even though I’m bursting with questions. But I believe him viscerally when he says: “The Chalkers are transparent here. Any agency they have, it really belongs to the Ripples.”</p>
<p class="p1">“You really think the Ripples could build it?” I ask, affecting skepticism, trying not to let him know <i>I know</i>.</p>
<p class="p1">“I think it’s the simplest explanation for what we observe.”</p>
<p class="p1">The comedown has subsided, and the spinning in my head is no longer pleasant. Between the two of us I think we’ve exhausted most of the oxygen in this damp little basement cell. I try to look at Tethi as though for the first time, to see whether I can really imagine him as a Chalker. I can’t imagine being more sure.</p>
<p class="p1">“I need to go, Tethi. This paper — I don’t know. I’ll have to think about it.”</p>
<p class="p1"><i>Thank God he doesn’t try to stop me</i>. That’s my first thought, and it doesn’t sit well with me. Normal people in Shanghai, outside of my little neikotics bubble, plenty of them know someone who was in and out of the Chalk. They don’t talk about it, because they can’t. It doesn’t make them criminals. Tethi doesn’t even move from his chair. He only gives me this devastatingly unsurprised look that says, yeah, YINS, I figured you’d disappoint me.</p>
<p class="p1">And I’m up the ladder and up the stairs and out the door of Min’s Misc. And I’m on the metro, still thinking. <i>Eggs in the Sea. Eggs in the Sea.</i> At this distance it blurs. It already resembles delusions I’ve shaken off before.</p>
<p class="p1">But for all the questions it raises, it offers another, enormously satisfying answer. The market value of a Mirror Sea feed has skyrocketed in the past few years. The Weather Bureau has gotten cagier about live feeds, all while the wards have learned to treat them as liquid gold. The YINS Observatory, cloistered at the fringes of mathematics and biology, they’re one buyer. The Big Three are another. Everyone assumes they’re a speculative asset. That Suowei wants them for the same reason that they launch interceptors at inauspicious asteroid belt objects — they’re hyperstitious, insane, and print money. But what if it was a good investment? Suppose the Mirror Sea really exists as a hunting ground for neikotic eggs? Suppose Cai Yuhui is in the race?</p>
<p class="p1">When I get home, I open the Soup on my tablet. My paper is in a hole about eight times deeper than before. I could revise it tomorrow and resubmit with my YINS key. Yeah. I could cut Tethi out of the picture, cut him loose back into the Chalk, let him flounder and die in that Zhabei basement. Real nice, Mona.</p>
<p class="p1">So I guess I have a new collaborator. I open a new direct message and type:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">What do you think we do now?</p>
