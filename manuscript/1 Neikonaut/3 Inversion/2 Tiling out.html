<p class="p1">On the far side of the Bridge, though, the rest of me has been waiting.</p>
<p class="p1">A large, jagged polyhedron of tiles, coal-black and glossy yellow, comes floating lazily out. I send it to the voxelite printer. Once I would stand vigil for the diving-bell, hoping against hope for the strangest kind of reunion; now I slam the Deng Bridge shut with no hesitation. Time to go home. How? Right. <i>Thumbs.</i></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Right thumb.</i> I slam the big dumb button. The drip stops, the tiles become larger, slower, simpler, I can feel my whole being flattened into a single plane of pixelated color, reaching for combinators, lenses, callbacks, pointers, registers and feeling only blind, dumb, organic chaos. Remembering on hard-won instinct not to panic here, <i>it's okay, you'll be back.</i></p>
<p class="p1">I'm blinking. I'm biting hard on my tongue, my whole mouth tastes like iron. The UTMS bed is slick with sweat.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>I can hear the printer running already, constructing a voxelite shard, a death mask of Mbetethi’s debris projected downward into three dimensions. A memento. A desk toy. Contraband. I can never anticipate what these will look like, and yet I'm never, ever surprised.</p>
<p class="p1">The visor is black now, save for four softly pulsing characters: <i>INVERSION COMPLETE.</i> I lift it from my face to see Mbetethi staring dumbstruck at me. Freed from a dozen tiny paralyses, his expression looks much more natural now.</p>
<p class="p1">"W-w-w-what did you do? What happened in there?"</p>
<p class="p1">The neikonaut's first and last question. Our oldest and saddest joke. Mbetethi asks through heavy breaths as though he really wants to hear the answer, waits for just a tick, then turns on his heels and flees the clinic without waiting for the punchline.</p>
<p class="p1">"I have absolutely no idea," I mumble.</p>
