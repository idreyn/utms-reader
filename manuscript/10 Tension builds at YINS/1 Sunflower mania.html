<p class="p1">Sunflower mania grips Shanghai.</p>
<p class="p1">Consider my downstairs neighbor, a man with red cheeks and a shock of white hair who we call Lao Miao. A retired mechanic, the man to beat at chess in our little combover of a park, a big hit with the aunties. Miao considers himself a citizen of Xietu South Ward, and then of the People’s Republic of China, and nothing in between. He keeps his long-expired Chinese <i>shenfenzheng</i> card taped to the back of an old cell phone, the chip from his YZID reluctantly stuffed inside. He gambles in renminbi, wins in parallel yuan, and goes down the street to exchange it right back. He gripes about Blue Delta’s overreaction to the Xia Zitian thing. Now <i>there</i> was a man, he once mused to no one in particular, who made a single mistake! And admitted it!</p>
<p class="p1">For Lao Miao, Shanghai’s estrangement from Beijing is a sad, slow-motion mistake orchestrated by the masochists at Blue Delta and the egomaniacs at the Big Three. It’s not something normal people want. And it does take a certain lanyard-induced hypoxia to muster any pride for the Yangtze Delta Very Special Economic Zone, and for its strange new byproducts: parallel, counterfactual, virtual, neikotic. But every so often something breaks that barrier. Once in a while Shanghai produces something only Shanghai really knows how to produce, that the rest of the world actually needs. On such a day there’s a sense of being here and not there, now and not then, in the eye contact on the subway and the downbeat of the chatter with the danbing guy. On such a day even Lao Miao might be cajoled, no doubt by a chorus of park aunties on yoga mats, into wearing a little sunflower on his lapel.</p>
<p class="p1">“Good morning, Mona,” he calls as I step outside. I would never have guessed he knows my name, but he positively sings it (high-high), in that reedy voice of his, classic and fine-tuned like one of his mopeds. It’s the most pleasant interaction we’ve ever had.</p>
<p class="p1">The ads on the metro for skin cream and yogurt and daycare have all been reconvolved to bloom with sunflowers. The Malay women in the Century Avenue interchange are selling the things by the dozen, either printed from voxelite or newly dead. The subtitled YZTV broadcast playing right above my head is one interview after another, with bankers and engineers and the Ward Council, about how the Sunflower Sieve will revolutionize banking and engineering and petty bickering. I listen carefully through the tinny speakers as Suowei, Paracoin, and Chaoyue get their words in edgewise. One of these companies had an exclusive feed into the part of the Mirror Sea where the Sieve egg was constructed — or so they thought. Their takes are all sunshine, but one of these reps is having a very bad day.</p>
<p class="p1">No one mentions the debris. As I step off at Dongtanglu, a little girl tugs on her mother’s arm and points at the cutouts in my hair: “<i>I</i> want to be a neikonaut!”</p>
<p class="p1">I feel a little queasy.</p>
<p class="p1">The whole city seems to be converging on Dongtanglu today, tourists and school groups all paying a visit to YINS. The workers at the one little ice cream shop are drowning in business. I really can’t help but notice that the ward’s little Mirror Sea, normally barren, is dense with Ripples, twinkling with supranormal amounts of yellow and black. <i>Do the Ripples know they’re a tourist attraction?</i> Even the sky, cloudless and bright, is getting into the spirit.</p>
<p class="p1">Building 1’s lobby is packed with tour groups, formal and not. The ceiling is quickly filling up with children’s irrecoverable sunflower balloons. The quasigram centerpiece is playing an animation on loop. Before: a hopelessly complicated neikotic whatsit, a graph structure that hurts to look at. It spins rapidly into a yellow-petal blur-bloom. After: a beautifully streamlined version of the same thing. Every last byte of incidental complexity removed.</p>
<p class="p1">Everyone is having a field day except the neikonauts cramming the basement-bound elevators.</p>
<p class="p1">They’ve learned the Sieve — what choice do they have? — and now they’re facing the consequences.</p>
<p class="p1">I see the vantablack spikiness behind their eyes, searching, grasping...for itself. For more of itself. It cannot be otherwise. The wall-to-wall crowd in the waiting area has the critical mass to make this clear. There’s a sticky, spiderweb clockwork to the way eye contact works in this room. I see strangers regarding each other, long gazes from corner to corner, before ripping their eyes away and moving on. This, not <i>quite</i> on beat, but there’s a low and faltering rhythm, a <i>tick, tick, tick</i> spreading into a brush-sweep <i>trush-trush-trush</i>. I tune into this, feel it intensify, tune in further and feel myself go briefly out of focus. A parabola makes itself known in the turn of my stomach. For three terrifying <i>ticks</i> I feel primarily like the vertex of a hundred shifting, interlaced triangles...<i>tick, tick, TICK.</i> I really need to call that number that Cai gave me, of a private quadratic belief specialist. I need a glass of water...</p>

<p class="p1">I spend the morning helping Dr. Rui unpack two new Kanwei scanner beds — there suddenly seems to be money in the Neikotic Safety budget — peeling off the stickers, calibrating the sensors, and installing the aftermarket beamformers that make them suitable for clinical use. The two of us were to meet to discuss my Sunflower Sieve paper, but the faculty are convening an emergency meeting.</p>
<p class="p1">“We’re supposed to be setting up a clinic on using the Sieve safely. But I simply don’t have any idea how to use it without generating debris.” He gives me a searching, even desperate look. “Do you?”</p>
<p class="p1">My job is to pretend to work on my paper. Actually, I’m refreshing my messages, waiting for a response from Tethi. I’m starting to wonder whether I’ll ever see him again, when I realize —</p>
<p class="p1">“What are you <i>doing</i> here?” I hiss, when I spot him in the Building 2 cafe. I almost don’t recognize him, because he’s wearing a pair of commemorative sunflower sunglasses.</p>
<p class="p1">He stabs at his salad, looking faintly put out. “Getting an inversion. Maybe seeing you.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Sorry. Sorry. I’m just on edge.”</p>
<p class="p1">He flips up the sunglasses, gives me a long and curious look, and gestures at the open chair. “I was just down there,” he says eventually. “I don’t quite know how to put this, but I think the Sunflower Sieve debris is multiplayer.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Multiplayer.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Tell me you don’t know exactly what I mean.”</p>
<p class="p1">“No, I do,” I insist through a laugh. “Just...<i>multiplayer</i>.”</p>
<p class="p1">For a second we’re both smiling. He pushes the sunglasses back over his eyes. “The weirdest thing is that this seems to help, a lot. It deflects eye contact, and the grabby-grabbiness of the debris can’t lock on.”</p>
<p class="p1">“We could run an experiment,” I find myself saying. “We could get a bunch of neikonauts together, and see whether their Sunflower Sieve debris <i>interacts</i>. It’s crazy —”</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s not. Only we’d need some seriously portable hardware...”</p>
<p class="p1">The weirdest sensation, a kind of easy, relaxed co-curiosity, washes over me. The parallax of mutual interests and mutual regard. It’s how they sell you on a Ph.D., but after three years, I’m startled and even a little appalled to find that it...really does exist. All morning I fretted about the promise I blindly made to Tethi that we’d co-author a paper. Suddenly it’s all I want to do. The plan that’s forming, the sun-washed memory I’m forming as we wander campus, refining what seems like an insane idea into a workable one — it feels like a brand-new start.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s only after I head back downstairs that the question emerges: what am I going to tell Deng?</p>
