<p class="p1">I decide to come clean. Well, sorta. There’s a narrow fifteen-minute slot open on both Deng and Rui’s calendars, and I squeeze myself into it. I bring my collection of voxelite Sieve debris, watching their eyes widen as I show them the various ways the pieces fit together. I slide a hard copy of <i>Sunflower Sieve Debris as a Tilespace Basis </i>across the table and watch their eyes widen more. It’s exactly what I wrote, minus one small and inconsequential footnote.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s pleasantly, reassuringly easy to tell a version of events with all references to the Mirror Sea sanitized away. It reinforces my daytime sense that the Sea really is nothing more than a giant Rorschach test, a sort of kaleidoscopic lava-lamp thinking aid whose patterns we latch onto because they reflect the lurking, barely subliminal ideas we’re about to have. Did Tethi find the Sunflower Sieve egg in there? Are the hyperlagmites really made of the same primitive pieces as the Sieve’s debris? In mid-September sun, these belong to the same class of question as <i>was that cloud shaped like a turtle? </i>And <i>was the image of Jesus really on that toast?</i></p>
<p class="p1">In my parallel construction, Tethi is an <span class="s1">anonymous</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s3">[Need to dance around Mona giving his name here.]</span>, strait-laced, small-time loop-lock engineer with a passing interest in neikotic debris, and the two of us have a proposal for an experiment. “We’d need to borrow some portable UTMS nets. Create a cocktail party type of environment for a group of neikonauts insigilated with the Sieve debris and see if it —” I want to use the word <i>interacts</i>, but that idea feels like a steep climb, pushing me against the back of my chair. “See if the shape of each individual’s debris predicts anything about their behavior.”</p>
<p class="p1">Deng and Rui keep hitting each other with these inscrutable little glances, as though blaming each other’s crackpot research programs for my incubating my fledging, crackpot idea. The conference room’s clock ticks through their silence, and I can be certain that at the end of these fifteen minutes, both of them will agree on one thing: this meeting is over.</p>
<p class="p1">“There is literature on this sort of thing,” she finally begins, slowly. “From the early days.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Your advisor is being too modest,” insists Rui, a little too sharply. “She did this work. Sadly, so much of that early neikotics research was classified and was never published. Some of it is lost to time, irretrievable...”</p>
<p class="p1">“It was lost because there were no results. We never found evidence that neikotic debris retained any generative, coherent qualities like the ones you observe here. Although the field of soberware did spring from the observation that it might somehow be coaxed to do so,” she adds, needling Rui, who rolls his eyes fractionally.</p>
<p class="p1">“In any case,” he concludes, “the interpersonal experiments were the least promising of all. We were never able to conclusively transmit even single bits between minds this way. We’re certainly not saying it’s impossible, Mona. Whatever is happening with the debris from the Sieve is novel and worth investigating. Why don’t you and your, uh, friend, pull together a proposal and we’ll review it in a week or two?”</p>
<p class="p1">“I really just need —”</p>
<p class="p1">“You’ll need IRB approval for this,” Deng cuts over my objection. “And they’ll be most amenable to active experimentation with the Sieve’s debris if we give things some time to settle down out there.” She jerks her thumb out towards the line neikonauts now spilling out of the clinic and onto the Safety floor. Some are in blinders and earplugs, visibly struggling to cope with the Sieve debris; others are chatting like they’re queued up for a buffet.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">* * *</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“She said we’d need IRB approval,” is what I tell Tethi. In recent days he’s taken to strolling around YINS, as though trying on the campus for size. After our meeting, which concluded with grim precision at three sharp, I find him crouched in the acacia grove on the quad, sipping a large yellow smoothie.</p>
<p class="p1">“What’s that?” he asks.</p>
<p class="p1">As we walk around campus, I relay to him how difficult getting this project past Deng and Rui will be. Secretly, I feel an incredible relief for telling them what I’ve been up to, and a certain satisfaction in showing Deng what’s come of my little debris collection.</p>
<p class="p1">But I find myself getting worked up. “Actually? Honestly? I don’t think they want us to do it. It’s bringing up some back-in-the-day bullshit between them, I’m certain of it.” Tethi is nonplussed by this, visibly enjoying the sun and the breeze. He must think I’m determined to rile him up. “Doesn’t all this bother you?” I ask a minute later, gesturing at his sunglasses, at his smoothie, at the general sunflower mania. “<i>You</i> came up with it.”</p>
<p class="p1">He shakes his head. “The Ripples did,” he insists.</p>
<p class="p1">We’ve done five or six laps around this discussion in the last few days. I’ve gradually settled on the belief that the Sieve egg in the Mirror Sea was — not a hallucination, necessarily, but a suggestive visual aid. <i>But that’s all a neikotic egg ever is,</i> Tethi insists again and again. <i>I’ll put you back in, and you can look at the hyperlagmites.</i> And I would reply with something wildly out of my mathematical depth, positing that the debris looks like the hyperlagmites because of some deep correspondence between the Sieve and the Lam-Waldmann Hash. Quietly, I don’t want to believe that the Ripples built it. I get parabolically queasy, thinking those words in that order. And, complicating matters, that black-within-black part of Tethi’s little Mirror Sea has gone offline. We only have the recordings to look at, and those can only be considered incomplete. You can tell from the curvature that the egg-ish hyperlagmite structure extends into higher dimensions that we’d be able to see...</p>
<p class="p1">“...If only we only had more cameras,” Tethi comes around to, again. And I know what he’s implying.</p>
<p class="p1">“...<i>Absolutely</i> not! I know the people at the Observatory, and they’ve gotten very strict about their feeds.”</p>
<p class="p1">...Which is more ammunition for his contention that the Sea is a hunting ground for neikotic eggs.</p>
<p class="p1">In a sense, this feels just like one of my endless, circular disagreements with Dr. Deng. But I enjoy it immensely. Arguing with Tethi seems to spiral up towards something, and I’m happy to do it for the entire afternoon. And then I turn around to drop off my smoothie container, and he’s gone. Abrupt and distinctly Chalker-esque, in that way. After he leaves, I feel very alone on campus. And in a broader sense, suddenly...not.</p>
<p class="p1">When I get home, there’s a brief message for “Zhang Peifeng”: <i>I have a crazy idea.</i></p>
