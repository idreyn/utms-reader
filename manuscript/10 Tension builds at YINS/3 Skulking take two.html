<p class="p1">And when I return to the Safety floor, via the tunnels, Deng and Rui are arguing. About me. I hear them coming around the bend, whispers echoing off the bare concrete. For what it’s worth, when I duck behind a large wheeled sanitation bin, it’s a fight-or-flight evasive maneuver. But from that point on — once I catch my breath — obviously I’m trying to snoop.</p>
<p class="p1">“— tell her that we’d take a look at it.” Deng is whispering harshly. “Are you absolutely out of your mind?”</p>
<p class="p1">“This arrangement can’t last, Jinghan. It’s just not fair to her. <i>She</i> is the one doing the work —”</p>
<p class="p1">They pass out of earshot, to the elevator bank. Rui calls for the upper floors, and I watch the readout tick to the fifth floor. I grab the next elevator, and follow them up. On the way, I ransack my backpack for a reason to be up here. Aha: a 48-piece puzzle of lights and prisms, the kind of soberspace projection too complicated to call an egg, overdue to the library. The doors open, and I see Deng and Rui make a right. I pace down the hall, the velvet bag of prisms clacking loudly, that was stupid — and catch them, still in heated conversation, out of earshot, somehow both shouting and whispering. Rui opens a door to a balcony just behind the stacks.</p>
<p class="p1">That might have been the end of my skulking. Only the windows in this part of the library are fashioned as a great matrix of primer tiles that bathe the reading room in slowly-shifting squares of color, biased orange by the early-evening sun. Knowing they can’t see me from outside, I creep through the stacks, parallel to Deng and Rui, and plant myself in the shelves, my face now plastered against the one-way window.</p>
<p class="p1">Through the glass, over the wind, I can’t hear a damn thing they’re saying. Rui waves his index finger out over the river, and then at himself. Deng folds her arms and fumes: <i>not gonna happen.</i> But I’m starting to think it has to do with...poor taste in department memorabilia. Rui produces a padded manilla envelope full of identical floppy somethings, and slides one out: it’s, duh, a sunflower. An abstract, embroidered patch: the kind you see on a space suit, or occasionally a neikosuit, if those were anything more than formalwear these days. He waves it in Deng’s face, and I can’t help but imagine him saying: <i>I worked really hard on this!</i></p>
<p class="p1">But Deng is having none of it. She rips it from his hand and slaps him across the face with it, left-right-left. Then, furious like I’ve never seen her, she storms back inside, sending the door ricocheting. A small chorus of <i>shhhh</i>’s ensues. Rui stands frozen in place, and so do I, too shocked to unwedge myself from between these bookcases. Only much later do I realize I forgot to drop the bag at the returns desk.</p>
