<p class="p1">Tethi’s plan is so crazy that it only works on a Friday. Until then, my job is to surreptitiously collect some electronic bits and bobs — a few very specific capacitors, some optical isolators, an RF downshifter — from around YINS. He sends me a few .vxl files to print; again, the conspicuous sounds of tiny, selfsame pieces clattering into the print tray. And he has me leave these in a very specific bucket under a very specific bridge near the boundary of Zhabei. <i>I think I’m being tailed,</i> he insists to “Zhang Peifeng”. <i>I don’t want to drag you into that.</i> By whom? He doesn’t specify, but I have a few guesses.</p>
<p class="p1">What keeps me distracted in the meantime is a little game called Mona Is The Big Hero. En route to an afternoon shift, I get a call from the clinic, my wanji ringing forcefully as I wait to tap into Dongtanglu. Yao’s on the line.</p>
<p class="p1">“Anything up?” I ask, drumming my fingers on the faregate. It churns, reading the ward trail off my card.</p>
<p class="p1">“There’s — ah, a staff meeting in 1-006. Last minute, not on the calendar. It, ah...”</p>
<p class="p1">He’s blown it, and he knows it.</p>
<p class="p1">“I’ll be there in five.”</p>
<p class="p1">My surprise party, which is no longer a surprise, draws most of the Safety department. YINS-colored streamers, a sunflower cake frosted with a goofy transliteration of my English name, K-hop playing tinnily from Dr. Guo’s little bluetooth speaker. A mixture of amusement and discomfort when I realize that the balloons are custom-fabbed, in shape and color and texture, to resemble the diving-bell. I don’t love that people have examined it this closely.</p>
<p class="p1">Dr. Qin, the department head, gives a neatly parceled little speech about my crucial contribution at a crucial time, making the otherwise unsafe Sunflower Sieve tractable to use. “This is only the first step,” he concedes. “For the Sieve to reach its full potential, YINS must redouble its efforts to produce a version that does not produce any debris at all.” He nods graciously to Deng, who has been looking awfully flustered. People keep mentioning <i>The Bridge</i>, <i>The Deng Bridge</i>, and she roves around white-knuckling a plastic fork like a prison shiv. She and Rui are doing this binary-star thing where they’re on opposite sides of the room at all times. His sunflower patches, apparently, didn’t make the cut.</p>
<p class="p1">The real, unpleasant surprise is that someone from the YINS press office is here to profile me.</p>
<p class="p1">“Tell me about your childhood,” she says, over the whir of the camball.</p>
<p class="p1">So I tell her about cable cars and a stray flock of parrots. Dim sum on Sundays with men in vests and women in blazers, my parents and their friends always talking about<i> building</i> this or that, me staring out the half-fogged window wondering where it could possibly be. Geriatric beach-fossil San Francisco given six months a hundred times, her sweets and stories for me, the sickness glimpsed early through car windows between soccer and robotics. Tents. Fire. Asthma.</p>
<p class="p1">“We need a few hundred seconds of facial movement,” she says when I pause for breath, peeking up from her tablet. “Just keep talking.”</p>
<p class="p1">My first acid trip too early, the whole city hanging by the thread of the Bay Bridge. The long running joke about how California should go it alone. The conspiracy, from left and right, from within and without, that made it real. The president calling it a Mexican colony, a Chinese colony, old snarls on new lips, the last few rungs of that awful ladder rusting and snapping off. A mayor walks into a drone tipped with carfentanyl, and no one in her office carries narcan. Smoke. Tremors. Waves.</p>
<p class="p1">"Tell me about Stanford?"</p>
<p class="p1">Men in uncertain uniform watching who gets off at Palo Alto. Ha, not redlights, but you get the idea. Hills of quiet flax, my world shrinking. My parents in deep Marin with solar panels and a sheepdog and a gun, more train rides in the other direction. Los Angeles, vibrant and present with its own decay and regeneration. Ayahuasca work with fortunate sons and poverty's daughters. The fog I was born in lifted from my mind, a repressed urge to engage rather than observe, wondering if I should change majors, change schools, on the return trip north. Right, Stanford...</p>
<p class="p1">"When you met Dr. Deng, did you realize who she <i>was</i> at the time?"</p>
<p class="p1">Another bad semester, another holiday break with a near-stranger in Venice Beach. In January, an oddly formal email to the plant-medicines mailing list. A ten-minute conversation in Deng's pompous English and my underbaked Mandarin, a half-finished machine and her inside it with a soldering iron. A stack of papers in Chinese filled with words my translator app didn’t even know yet, laying out a whole new field called <i>neikongxue</i>. And suddenly, a reason to stay enrolled and keep my GPA above water: I was a barnacle on this little group building something called a UTMS scanner, one of the first of its kind Stateside. When it was done, I would sit inside and — in a way that I could hardly imagine<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— speak directly to a computer in its own language.</p>
<p class="p1">And no. I didn't realize who she was at the time.</p>
