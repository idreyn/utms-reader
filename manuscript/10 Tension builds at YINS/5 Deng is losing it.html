<p class="p1">And when the interview’s over, Dr. Deng is gone. <i>Not feeling well,</i> she informs me.<i> Let’s postpone check-in. </i>Which makes it all the spookier when I find her very late that evening as I wander the upper floors of Building 1. I am, ahem, borrowing from the fab for my excursion with Tethi on Friday. She is, uh, staring out the window? Her knuckles are still white; her hair has slightly escaped its containment zone. Her eyes are barely six inches from the glass, fixed on something in Shanghai’s acrobatic, unrelentingly illuminated core. And then on me.</p>
<p class="p1">“You should go home,” is my honest appraisal of the situation.</p>
<p class="p1">Deng coughs quietly. Seems to locate her voice. “We should talk.”</p>
<p class="p1">We take a stray table against the window. I avoid even thinking about my backpack.</p>
<p class="p1">“I checked the Soup to find out what happened to your paper, and I’m sorry to see the negative reaction it got. I think this is a remarkable find. If it helps, I’m willing to co-sign when the resubmit window unlocks.”</p>
<p class="p1">She doesn’t mention the footnote. But Dr. Deng is not the kind of person who skips footnotes.</p>
<p class="p1">“Dr. Rui said he’d —”</p>
<p class="p1">“He and I had another conversation. We both agree the sensible thing is for you and I to work together. I <i>am</i> your advisor.” There are detectable levels of pride in the way she says that. But it’s mixed in with so much else. “Mona, you may be surprised to hear this, but you don’t have to hide your fascination with the Mirror Sea from me. I look at it too, you know. I think it’s beautiful. I struggle with what I see in it.”</p>
<p class="p1">For a moment I don’t know what to say. I try to force out a laugh. “That footnote was a convolution artifact.”</p>
<p class="p1">“From loop-lock, at least, you believed it warranted mention.”</p>
<p class="p1">“I’ve been doing my best to keep my problem under wraps.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Good.” She scratches her ear. “Very good. Let’s put that aside. I wanted to talk about something else.”</p>
<p class="p1">It takes her several winding sentences to reveal that this <i>something else</i> is the Deng Bridge.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Your use of the </span><span class="s2">diving-bell</span><span class="s3"> </span>[Let’s think about the specific ways in which Deng used the diving-bell as part of the Mirror Sea project.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">And how neikotic debris might be involved mechanically there.]</span> as an inversion capsule is wonderfully clever. But I worry. I worry...” She trails off. She doubles back. “Do you have any memories of occupying it?”</p>
<p class="p1">I have memories of memories of telemetry. Thunderclaps of deep green. Sheaves of crumbling tiles, immense pressure from all sides. Something looming, distant, grabbing at remove. In my dreams, I’m approaching, always approaching. And before I get a good look it lashes out at me. In all of this, some undercurrent I can’t name...</p>
<p class="p1">“No,” I finally decide. “Not really.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Nothing from the very moment of inversion?”</p>
<p class="p1">She orbits her point like this, always, hoping I’ll say the thing she doesn’t want to. Here is another loop I want to break. “Deng <i>jiaoshou</i>, it makes me anxious when you fret about me and won’t say why. Just...what is it?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Fine,” she replies, speaking fast. “Fine. Thirty thousand neikonauts in the city using the Sieve. Call it three, six million times your inversion is run in a year. That diving-bell is you. A surprising amount of you. A very generalized kind of agency compressed into a very few tiles.”</p>
<p class="p1">I speak slowly, flatly, ill at ease. “I know this.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Your skill — your raw neikonautic ability — is why I brought you to Shanghai.”</p>
<p class="p1">Oh, I get twitchy when she says that. You didn’t <i>bring</i> me anywhere, old woman.</p>
<p class="p1">“And that skill,” she continues, “is on display every time the Sunflower Sieve inversion is fired into a mind. The diving-bell is dropped into a foreign tilespace, with little context on the problem, and yet it finds and inverts the Sieve debris in a few seconds, wall-clock. I don’t think we’ve observed a single failure.”</p>
<p class="p1">I have an inkling of what she’s getting at. I’m determined to make her say it.</p>
<p class="p1">“So...what? You want to give it a medal? Fab keychains of it, sell ‘em at the bookstore?”</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s persistent. It’s resourceful. It understands the mechanics of loop-lock very well, and the mechanics of neikotic debris. And maybe...”</p>
<p class="p1">“Maybe?” I feel hard. Brittle. “Maybe what?”</p>
<p class="p1">“I’m so, so sorry, Mona, I wanted this to go another way, to use other words.” She is shaking as though from cold, and that tremor carries into her voice. “I want to make sure, at the end, it <i>dies</i>.”</p>
<p class="p1">So I just pick myself up from the table and go. I feel made of lead from head to foot. I feel like the mirrors lining the elevator are there to shame me, and me, and me, and me, half-wave resonance whistling through this hole where empathy should go. Somehow I am determined not to let this rock my good streak with Deng. As usual her point is right and she picked the wrong way to make it. I don’t really know anything about how the Bridge works. Or what the diving-bell might do to survive.</p>
<p class="p1">I’m sick of taking the long way through Dongtanglu, away from the displays. Fuck that. I walk up right up to a viewport into the ward’s barren little Mirror Sea and blur my eyes, daring the parabola to take me, daring those listless, shifting forms to resolve for a second time into the diving-bell.</p>
<p class="p1"><i>If you’re really in there </i>— I find the thought low in my throat, soft on my tongue — <i>I’m sorry</i>.</p>
