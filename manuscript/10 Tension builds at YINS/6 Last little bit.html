<p class="p1">Friday comes. I’ve spent the day mostly avoiding Dr. Deng, who came up to my desk to apologize first thing this morning. <i>It’s been a very stressful week</i>, we both agreed, and exchanged smiles. Then, an hour later, she returned for an overtly casual round of small talk. And an hour later, again. We covered Sieve news, and Blue Delta’s proposed round of hamfisted ward mergers, and sports. Each time, Deng seems determined to make sure I’m okay, it’s okay, to fast-forward past the tender, awkward part. Quit picking at it!</p>
<p class="p1">So I went back up to the library. For better or worse I went back on those message boards, back to the <i>hyperlagmite theories</i> thread. The whole thing has run aground in the last year. Half the posters think the hyperlagmites were never there at all, and the other half insist that the Weather Bureau is filtering them out of the public displays. In real time, I watched someone get banned for asking <i>where to get up close and personal with live feeds??</i></p>
<p class="p1">Well, we know a place.</p>
<p class="p1">Later I fell asleep on a soft bench under the primer tiles, watching the colors change behind my eyes, half-dreaming about tonight. Really, Tethi and I are just kicking the can down the road. Imagine we do get some good data — the Institutional Review Board will never accept the circumstances of its collection. We’ll be no closer to publishing the kind of paper that he wants his name on. But if we prove to ourselves that it’s possible in the field, it should be possible to replicate at YINS. <i>Parallel construction. </i>We had a good laugh about the fact that between English, French, Fang, Farsi, Mandarin...we both know the expression only in Cantonese, as the title of a loose-cannon cop show set in Shanghai but filmed in Guangzhou.</p>
<p class="p1">I make my groggy way back to the Safety floor to grab my change of clothes, across the quad, already spilling over with the opening moves of undergrad nightlife. A few days back Tethi and I split a bag of spiked sourplums out here, <span class="s1">playing “I spy” as they traipsed past us into the night —</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“<i>I spy</i> someone fresh from Beijing”: in a smart but somewhat unimaginative sport coat, a pigeon among the parakeets of Shanghai’s geometric, androgynous qipaos and elaborate gauzy gowns.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“<i>I spy</i> someone whose long distance relationship is not going as well as they hoped”: Trailing her group of friends by a few steps and raising her exasperated voice her wanji.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“<i>I spy</i> someone who got a sports car for college and raised a fit when they couldn’t park it on campus”: Sporting a Wuhan Dangdai basketball jersey and leading three friends into a hailed veetle.</span></p>
<p class="p1">My other task in the basement, I suppose, is to reassure Deng for the weekend that I really don’t hate her —</p>
<p class="p1">“Oh — Mona.” At the back entrance to the Safety floor, I collide with Cai Yuhui.</p>
<p class="p1">I connect a weird series of dots: she’s wearing one of those sunflower stickers that says <i>I Got The Inversion!</i> She gestures to it with a smile. “You got me good in there. The inversion is really fast, really clean.”</p>
<p class="p1">“I, well...” My linguistic faculties drop the ball and I give her a weak little laser-pistol gesture. <i>Pew! </i>We both smile wordlessly, neither sure what to say. But I know what I’m thinking. I can read it off her face. From one skulker to another: <i>you’ve been skulking!</i> “Glad you enjoyed it,” I tell her instead.</p>
<p class="p1">Another beat of silence, uncertain if not unpleasant. Cai looks composed today. No dropped frames. She checks her wrist, apparently reading something off the paisely pattern drifting across her wanji. “I need to go. But it was <i>so</i> nice seeing you the other day. Even though — y’know! — you were crying. Come find me sometime.” She strides away, and when she marks ten paces, she twists around and blows me a kiss. It enters through the very center of my forehead and whizzes clean through my skull, hurtling towards densely populated downtown Shanghai.</p>
<p class="p1">I wobble through the double glass doors onto the Safety floor. Deng is gone. Everyone is gone. Even the clinic looks awfully empty. And that’s when I remember: <i>we ran out of those stickers two days ago.</i></p>
<p class="p1">From one skulker to another: what’s up, Cai?</p>
<p class="p1">Retrieving a dress and heels from a lower drawer, that’s when I see it. One petal peeking fractionally out from under my keyboard: one of Rui’s embroidered sunflower patches. I turn it. I smell it. In this light I see how faded the yellow is, how old it might be. What it says on the white text ringing its edges:</p>
<p class="p1"><i>Kui hua yi hao.</i> Sunflower 1.</p>
<p class="p1">Supervisor, Commander Deng Jinghan.</p>
