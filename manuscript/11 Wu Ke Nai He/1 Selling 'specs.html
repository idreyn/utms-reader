<p class="p1">“You gotta put the emphasis on the first syllable. Listen. <i>In</i>-tro-speeeecs!”</p>
<p class="p1">Tethi cups his hands, and his voice carries over the loose crowd milling around one of the unknowably many entrances to Wu Ke Nai He. They joked that the club is vast enough to qualify as a ward — and stopped joking when the owners filed the paperwork. This little segment of it, on the southeast corner of a sprawling twelve blocks, Baidu Maps still thinks is a warehouse full of vacuum parts.</p>
<p class="p1">“No. C’mon. You sound like you’re selling hot dogs at a baseball game. In Mandarin, you gotta get a patter going. Take everything we have and string it all together, a little too fast.” I bring my voice up into my nose: “Genzhe globes — Introspecs — Flower crowns — Quasi Wands — Genzhe globes...” I start rifling through our little pushcart, through layers of treasures and horrors pilfered from Min’s storeroom. “Christ, what else do we have in here?”</p>
<p class="p1">Tethi, who has never been to a baseball game in his life, gives me the stink eye. “Hey, who’s done this before?”</p>
<p class="p1">Just past ten, the crowd outside Wu Ke Nai He is still quite light. And for the most part, no one is fucked up enough to want to peruse our LED-soaked, quasmographic pre-trash. But Tethi assures me, and I have no reason to doubt him, that all that is going to change...soon. Ish. I’m glad I brought a jacket.</p>
<p class="p1">“Main act at one. A big wave will dose at eleven and land here at half past.” He checks his wanji, but his entire face is illuminated by his ridiculous glove, a second circulatory system of candy-colored light. To his credit he’s already sold three. “With a bit of royce or qingting in your system this shit will be irresistible. <i>In</i>-tro<i>-</i>speeeecs!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">* * *</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It was remarkable, even endearing, the way he had it all ready when I arrived: the pushcart, the sorted piles of rave paraphenalia, even a forged vendor’s permit. But he looked very, very tired. Up in his room, a little efficiency suite above Min’s Misc, he cleared electronic detritus off a table until only a pair of Introspecs remained.</p>
<p class="p1">“Try them on,” he invited, and I slid them over my eyes. “Can you tell?”</p>
<p class="p1">“I don’t think so. Maybe a little heavier than usual?”</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Introspecs are </span><span class="s2">a popular kind of club gizmo, red-hot a few years ago, a reilable standby. A pair of what might be sunglasses, every edge a curve, with a hi-res screen glazed across the conjoined outer lenses. Nothing special, except that along the stems are a handful of very rudimentary UTMS electrodes, used to divine the wearer’s emotion and then paint it in splashes of color across their eyes. Tethi had a hundred pairs of them, and in the last few days he had managed to gut and rewire...</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">“Fifteen,” he told me, popping an amphetamint. “I got it down to a process by the end, but those RF chips have some nasty small pins.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">“Think that’s a good ratio,” I concurred. Through the ‘specs everything looked a little darker, and I could make out just the faintest swirls of red and orange from the obverse side. It makes me nauseous. “So what do the sensors see?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">“Nothing.” Tethi shows me the readout from the Introspecs. “Good, right? You’re clean?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">I nod; I never touched the Sunflower Sieve a second time.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">I watch the 16x16 readout of blinking squares on Tethi’s rollscroll flare when he puts on the glasses. I did say <i>rudimentary</i> electrodes. But these reworked Introspecs, manually tuned to a narrow slice of the eta band, are perfectly serviceable Sieve debris detectors. That grabby, crawling nature is clear even at such coarse resolution. Tethi grimaces at what’s in his head, and I give him a sympathetic look.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">“If you come down the right way, it’s not so bad,” he posits.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">Min is doing laoban stuff downstairs, wiping the counter, dusting ancient clamshell casings. She regards Tethi’s pushcart like a long-forgotten toy. “You know this is how I found him? Selling trinkets to the qingting crowd?” There’s a lot in the look that Tethi shoots her. Gratitude, affection, discomfort. There’s a lot in the look that she shoots back. Pride, affection, concern. Broadband and narrowbeam, these glances. I catch all that from just the fringes. “Go on, get rid of it. It’s an awful waste of space and it doesn’t sell here.”</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">* * *</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">Tethi marked his fifteen special pairs with numbered orange stickers. The crowd thickens, the bass beckons; we sell a round dozen of the unmodified Introspecs. Then a customer approaches with giveaway hair cutouts. “A pair each for me and my girl,” he insists to Tethi. Shivering despite the night heat.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">“One hundred...ninety nine ninety eight for the both,” he decides, as the neikonaut’s hard wallet opens with a <i>ker-click</i> worth more than my life. Teth hesitates, deliberates, hands over a marked pair and an unmarked one. He grimaces as the marked pair goes to the girl. “<i>Merde</i>. So much for number six.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">But we manage to get eleven of the other fourteen pairs onto the faces of neikonauts. The other junk sells slowly, overlooked for oversized sunflowers offered by other pushcarts. We offload our wares to them for a song.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">Behind piles of corrugated rust we transform into patrons of Wu Ke Nai He. We peek, delighted, at the rollscroll: a healthy fraction of the readouts light up with Sieve debris. Still uncorrelated. The rollscroll gets taped inside Tethi’s jacket; the RF receiver gets taped far enough up my leg to justify a slap. I also tape an autovial there; hey, it’s a club.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">“We could just stay outside,” Tethi offers. “They won’t go out of range.” For two hours, we’ve watched the capillaries of the metro deposit thousands of people into the line before us. It folds into switchbacks, sprouts tributaries. Veetles impending with deadly heat from above have nowhere to land.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">I snap my gum, discontent with the idea. “Imagine there’s a correlation event and we don’t get to see it?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">“We won’t <i>see</i> it. It’s dead dark in there, aside from the pillars and the screens.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">All night I’ve been watching Tethi watch the people who pass as Wu Ke Nai He’s staff. Plenty to read off their skin, maybe, but you can get that inkwork over your lunch break downtown. It’s in the acute glances, clockweb and spiderwork; something spectral rears its head at a hundred twenty bpm. Tethi’s still tuned to it. He resonates passively, involuntarily. <i>Couldn’t you just...</i> I begin, under my breath. He lets it pass for silence.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">“You’re right,” he decides, buoyant. “We’ll see something. Plus, you really ought to see the place.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">And he’s plenty cheerful to slip in near the end of the line. But I think he knows I know.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">The line bleeds inevitably into the neighboring Suibian Ward, heavy res and light industry. This fact proves entertaining as we lurch slowly forward. Suibian’s redlights all look twenty-two, pimple-faced, undersized for their mall-cop getup. From their bank of the narrow street, their glo-wand waving has zero effect in directing autocabs and revelers back across the way. They snarl at Wu Ke’s Chalkers, who gaze placidly back. Then they call the real cops. A hefty Blue Delta veetle finds purchase. Bluelights spill out, unhappy to be here, channeling rump authority with more glo-wands.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">All the while dying to check Tethi’s rollscreen.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">(A reveler breaks out of line. To whoops and cheers, she tries directing traffic with glo-wands we sold her.)</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">All the while wondering about <i>Supervisor, Commander Deng Jinghan.</i> Was it Rui’s idea of a joke?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">Entry is by way of double velvet curtains, operated airlock-style by ghostly white hands. Immediately, bass subsumes all. Teth and I get one last glance, and then we’re split, by a black velvet wedge, into two security lines. I get a patdown that goes longer than strictly necessary...</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">The attendant patting me down takes the autovial for granted, and completely misses the RF receiver. “Your gum,” he drones, gesturing hand-it-over.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">“My <i>gum</i>? For real?” Suddenly I’m prepared to blow the whole operation over half a pack of Mint San Wei.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">“We’re the Weather Bureau,” his buddy insists. He has knifepoint sigil-scars wreathing his eyes and a lollipop in his cheek. “And the Bureau needs your gum.” With an orange-stained smirk he counts out four sticks for each of them, and hands me two back. But I’m in. All hints of geometry or scale are subsumed by matte black. Hesitant, diagonal steps, cutting sideways through the pressure. But the pressure carries me around another velvet wall.</span></p>
