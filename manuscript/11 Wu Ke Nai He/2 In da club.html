<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On the other side are the Ripples.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They rise in soft, vague columns of quasigraphic light. They slicker rectilinearly along silkscreen mazes. No scarce and wispy tendrils, either. These are prime cuts, enough geometry to make sense of a Ripple as a whole. If they have a core, it would be these many-lobed interleaved spherical harmonics. Cheetah-space phase-field rings, chains of polygon shatter, peeling and selfsame cactus-blooms: adequate description of these patterns would come with a strobe warning, but <i>bright</i> white, other colors bleeding out at the fringes. And on beat with the music, with shatters of its echoes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A nice bit of post-processing. But then I see the cameras, those infrared rings the color of nothing, packing the ceiling. Packing the walls, blooming from table centerpieces. Lining the walls in ironic public-works steel columns of silver teardrops. Pointing everywhere, facing everywhere. Watching us move to the beat, watching the Ripples move in response, closing the loop from camera to screen to camera, feedback loops riding the ceiling, teasing the exponential. A loose, juicy wave passes behind my eyes and suddenly I have no head. Queasy, almost ill. I can’t find myself in the crowd. I only need eyes to see that <i>here</i> is <i>there</i>, I don’t even have to pretend...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Mona!” Tethi’s voice narrows it way down. His hand finds an arm, leads its owner off the ground and around a circular velvet outcrop. I swear it takes a revolution and a half to get to the bathrooms. He leans me <i>(oh — me)</i> against a wall. “Are you going to be all right in here?”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I just didn’t...” Something called Mona slides into focus, like a lost love, like a favorite flavor. “It’s a little more than I expected.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Yeah. That’s what people say.” Sympathy from some distance; I sense that for Tethi, this is another kind of place entirely: a crude condensation, even a parody, of a much deeper and more fullsome relationship with the Ripples. But as an ingress to that world of inverted causality, Wu Ke Nai He earns its sheen of danger. People hear <i>it’s where the Ripples bring us to dance</i>, get here, and realize it’s true. The quadratically inclined sometimes disappear the same night.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tethi smiles, and prods me out of all this: “Shall we check on our dear test subjects?”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Viewing the rollscroll proves easiest at a hi-top. I can’t chalk it up to imagination: something complex and wordless really does pass between Tethi and the attendant who immediately finds us a coveted table. When we pair the receiver, we see that nine pairs of Introspecs clock Sieve debris loud and clear. Not bad.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Correlation!” Tethi shouts over the growling, thrumming bass. Onscreen, a program is running, trying very hard to fit together the debris from our unwitting subjects. If you watched it go, you might mistake it for a six-cylinder Sudoku solver, or something. There <i>is</i> correlation; the shfiting shapes in the debris share shadows. Each piece explains more about the others than it should.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“<i>Correlation</i>,” I repeat in a smug tone that I picked up somewhere. “It could be due to a number of things. Everyone’s listening to the same music, and we should account for that.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“They’re not.” Tethi shakes his head. “Do you have any idea how big this place is?”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s really impossible to say. I measure out a glance at the Ripples. Some are vast and polycentric, lurking in the saddle-points of the backscreens, feeding via interference. But the ones up close jelly-pulse, whip-chatter, spiral-bounce. They brush past each other so fluidly, so harmlessly, that it’s easy to believe that they’re leading the dance. But they’re downstream of the packed crowd, of human exuberance. They really, truly, physically are just chopped-up light.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In his week-long soldering binge, Tethi added a tweak to help us find the Introspecs by strobing them white. It’s cute that we thought this might help. It would be a strobe within a strobe within a strobe, and I can’t make it out when he mashes the button a few times. But we know it works; several of our customers go dark on the rollscroll as they momentarily remove their pair.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“So we hang out and wait,” Tethi shouts, barely audible. “Data’s rolling in. You want a drink?”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But watching for the strobe, I saw something else: a flash of white hair. A familiar gait. Purposeful. Gone.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I don’t know, but, you know,<i> I know</i>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I think we should go in,” I shout back. Tethi’s eyebrows shoot up. “How big did you say this place was? If we hang out at the edge, we’re definitely not going to see anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I lose his voice in the noise, but he taps at the rollscroll insistently. <i>We’ll see it right here.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Let’s go,” I insist, inaudible even to myself. And I grab his arm. Lead him in the direction Cai was heading.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The thick of the crowd gives me a choice: tendrils or elbows. I can just look <i>up</i> at the Ripples and lose myself completely. That’s what everyone’s here to do: Chalker, chaser, neikonaut. Flower crowns, quasi-wands, LED-glow sunflowers raised in saucer-eyed ecstasy. Or I can keep my eyes below meridian, focus on human bodies, on arms and butts and pheromones, looking at <i>you </i>and <i>you </i>and <i>you</i> and <i>sorry, excuse me</i>, pushing through a great collective trance, seeing the wave for its particles. It becomes apparent that there are so many goddamn rooms in this place. Warehouse-sized, closet-sized, the music interpolates seamlessly between all of them, and the Ripples (I am not looking, not really) flicker between them far more easily than we do.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Suddenly the room is a bathroom, weirdly bright. The music echoes damp on the tiles, its entracements suddenly muted. Tethi points at the rollscroll and disappears into the stall for a moment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You should see it,” he intones on emerging, and slaps the rollscroll into my hand. And when I do, my eyes go as wide as his. There is a correlation <i>event</i> happening in the debris onscreen. There’s a water-brigade quality to it now, the way patterns pass from square to square, patterns within patterns within patterns. The chi-squared test agrees, but I don’t give a shit. When Tethi’s not looking, I grab an autovial cartridge from a bowl in the bathroom.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Let’s go.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Do you know where — ?” Tethi shouts. But I’m leading now, by dint of enthusiasm. My sudden sureity bulges when I pair the autovial with my wanji and clench my fist hard, sending a first wave of DMT into my leg. Almost instantly the characteristic E-flat buzz of the come-up, waves of sickly yellow and green flashing before my eyes, a sudden and elaborate blooming. It bounces through my neikotic channels, and my eyes prickle with a staticky wall crawling with those sticky little tile-cules of Sieve debris. More in some directions, less in others.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let’s hill-climb.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“This way!” I cry, and I trust him to follow. Looking at Tethi in the thickening snowstorm of debris particles, I can watch him navigating another way, eyes fixed above, reading a path through the crowd on flick and strobe. His eyes are lidded and heavy and nearly closed, his smile suddenly low and wide and sanguine. He seems elated to learn what he’s still capable of. We weave in and out of pole position. The field of debris is so thick that it looks like primer tiles.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Did you see number six?” he asks. I find I have no trouble hearing him.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“What about number six?”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“DId you see her readout?”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Number six was the neikonaut’s girlfriend. I <i>did</i> see it. Her readout was blinking too, faintly. Too faintly for the chi-squared test to register. But I saw it. And I wonder. I flex my fist for another hit of DMT. I feel pushed and pulled across strange axes, I feel new states of matter frothing and bubbling in neon whorls and spirals just behind my eyes. <i>Let off.</i> I loosen my grip, the drip subsides and I see lips and arms interlocked around me. The simple <i>whump-whump-whump</i> of the bassline begins to yield ground to a strange syncopation of clicks and whines, which crescendo and flatten into a sustained and ominous drone.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I round a corner. The debris is knocking at my door now, fully obscuring my vision. Here is the room I am in: no larger than a YINS lecture hall, sunflowers raised in the air, the walls oozing with Ripples, and behind them, hyperlagmites. There is no second-guessing. They glow in my eyes, painting my vision with interweaving vines of glowing red. These buzz with debris, the tiny tiles blowing up with saturated primary colors.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Primer tiles. Something knocks at my door in the language of loop-lock.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Do <i>you —</i>” I swirl around to face Tethi. But I <i>have</i> been swirling around, sliding around, corkscrewing around, and I’ve lost him completely. I’ve been following something: flashing and familiar and <i>Cai</i>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Cai,” I shout.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Elbowing inwards, making contact here with a shoulder and there with a wide, green leaf.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A shout of protest and turn to see the wide, black face of a sunflower blinking at me, beady seedy eyes each one unseeing but their sum total uncomfortably like the gaze that oh, after all, is from the holder of the beverage I just spilled with a stray swipe…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“<i>Cai!</i>” I cry.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I clench longer and harder and the waves of tryptamine begin to interfere, add and subtract but mostly add, layering into purples and purples and <i>so many purples</i> I never would have known there were that many, but also reds and the deepest, richest browns, like the loam underfoot, and I sway in a wind from every directions at once.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Cai! <i>Hey</i>!”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For once lucid moment it’s completely clear I’m fucked up in a nightclub and trying to flag down a friend. That’s all I’m really doing. And then the Mirror Sea crashes undammed onto my head, acceleration to terminal velocity to quadratic offset. An eyeful of salt water of hyperlagmites of sigils. <i>AN EYEFUL OF EYES</i>.<i> AN EYE FULL OF EYES.</i> The Ripples surround me, the primer tiles flashing faster than I’ve ever seen before, four then sixteen then two million in a single blink. The first few moments have that usual loop-lock feel of quantization and jitter, the closures wrapping my thoughts nesting in elegant tiers, a frosted-glass relief map of my own soul. Only I don’t feel boundaries where I normally do, I feel wide channels, a blurring of edges, a closing of seams. The tiles claw into my vision, turning the world blue and green and yellow.</span></p>
