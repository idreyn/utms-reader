<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cai looks me wide in the eye. Then she disappears into the sunflowers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I blink, eyes salty with sweat, in a staring contest with the flowers. She — <i>she</i> had been here! But the lapse is momentary. <i>Who</i>, Mona? The heat is getting to me. How many hours have I been chasing the sun through these wildflowers?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s absurd enough that this was my plan, more absurd still that for a long time, it appeared to work. What kind of stars, what kind of moon, will be here to light my path when my legs finally falter and the sun sets? It’s a risk I can’t afford to take, so I’ve been trudging steadily west, jogging in bursts, and keeping that sun above me. If that’s what it really is. I can hear it throwing off bursts of low rumbles and wind chime harmonics, and I find I can stare at it without pain, even strain my eyes to unpack its bright white into concentric, swirling choreographies. You know, sun stuff. But whenever I tear my eyes away it seems to have moved much further west. So for now I keep it in the corner of my eye and mind.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Instead I focus on the sunflowers and, in their own way, they focus on me. Each has at its center a thousand tiny onyx eyelets which form a large compound eye, with such hazy perception that you may stand in front of one for the span of ten breaths and make no more than the slightest smudge on its world. But plant them together and their roots tangle and intersect, sharing and elaborating on the same great image until they not only see you but seem to anticipate you. I crane my neck backwards now and in the uncountable miles of them rising and falling on shallow hills I can make out the gentlest trace of my presence where they have turned, too subtly to notice in the moment, to face me as I pass. Spend all day in the sunflowers and you begin to exist solely on their terms, your soul knit from grass and dew coursing through your veins, no trouble swifter than a hungry caterpillar even in the spectrum of your attention.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And spend too long away from the flowers — well, I shudder to think. I might buy a few minutes on the glance of a blackbird hanging off a reed, or grind my boots into the dirt with each step hoping to cave in an anthill, but the fabric of causality is ever-mending and ever-spooling into unseen depths. To be stitched out takes far less than I once thought: a few minutes in unobserved stillness will do it. I could rise from my reverie and find that the universe has simply moved on without me, found a better and simpler course through time that carries no trace of my past actions and leaves me no way back into the future. That such a thing has never been observed in missing socks, in hibernating raccoons, in elderly neighbors, is less than cold comfort — it is precisely the point. The truest terror is just out of our peripheral vision, on the lip of a maw too wide to see through our telescopes. Death is a smokescreen. We are right to fear it, but as the proximate cause of <i>this</i>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And the sun is lower in the sky now, and the sunflowers can’t see in the dark.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But I need a break, even under this reddening sky. Time passes so strangely here that my exhausted stumbling towards the stream, collapsing on the ground, and drinking my fill, are stretched into the same rubber-band present, finally snapping loose as I dunk my head underwater for the third or fourth time. <i>You’re going to die here, Mona</i>. <i>You’re going to go unseen and slip away.</i> Already I feel the creep of other possibilities that neatly fill my little vacuum in spacetime. I see it now in the widening bell curve of faces shimmering back on the surface of the stream, my close bob lengthening and my narrow face filling out. Something in my movement must at least mark me as human to the sunflowers, but increasingly I could be anyone, and after night falls I could be nothing more than a gentle breeze in their midst. <i>Mona Xu</i>, I say it out loud, trying to remember what it’s worth. No one is around to care.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The flowers that were peering down at me have lost their thin sheen of interest; I can’t even relax on the ground for very long. I wash the dirt from my hands, idly interested in the way it’s made of the same stuff as the water. Tiny glints of crawling sandy loam grasp the corresponding handles on tiny droplets of water, and they carry one another in a tumble down the stream.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A rustling behind me. A face peeks out of the sunflowers, and that’s all I can say about it: a face, human, a shifting mask of here-nor-thereness. Eyes lock. A probability distribution over fragmentary flashes of cheek and nose and mouth, the hollow of pupils the lone constant. I am bijectively seeing and seen, no longer sure which eyes I’m behind, watching my face shimmer as though it is my own. A wide, bright stream of tiles like sunlight shot down a dry well, riding a carrier wave of memories without referent: dusty rooms and deep forests and leathered hands. And bidirectional: fields of flax and steep asphalt and harsh sea air. Human memories up to the fringes, where they crawl with a fractal alphabet of fingered shapes, grasping, self-assembling...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I can no longer tell whose memories are whose, who is who. And the sunflowers certainly can’t. Barely, just barely, I know that we are two. I turn and run. The terrifying sensation of ripping your gaze from your reflection as it stares blanky ahead, its crawling vocabulary of lips always forming the same word: <i>help</i>. I run, feeling myself bud mitotically from this other human in the gaze of the sunflowers. I know it’s has happened many times already, but it’s less clear who it happened to. <i>Mona Xu</i>, that mere incantation — it drapes uselessly over the debris of mismatched memories, of thousands of plausible lives.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Desperate to be seen in the fading twilight, against a sea of hypnotically twinkling stars, I fake and dodge along the most implausible path through the sunflowers. They take a bleary kind of notice: my whole self is of spiraling footwork, zigzagging pathwork, horribly, ecstatically pure of form. Motion is alive, stillness is not. In this way I become a long, southward perturbation in the sunflowers, a jagged knife in their equilibrium. With a delirious grin I pick one randomly by the stem and give it a hard and unequivocal twist. A drowsy reproach hangs in the air, but the flower has already grown back. I charge along a lightning-ridge gradient, stopping every ten paces or so to rip off a sunflower, reveling in the perverse idea that wanton destruction, of course, is what could mark me as human until sunrise.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And then one foot falls and falls too long. I tumble over a bluff’s edge, head over heels over head. The last quarter-turn saves me. I land hard in steep sand and keep tumbling down a devilishly parabolic hill, passing thinning patches of sunflowers, slowing only in bare sand. It tickles and claws at my edges, its alphabet of digits grabbing and finding purchase at my boundary, becoming me. I try to stand, but my limbs are crumbling and formless, a gust of wind that looks briefly like a person, a trick of starlight. I try again, but there’s nothing to try with. Only the endless dance of interlocking sand-forms, deep reds and purples and browns. Patterns collapse and coalesce time and again, thrumming to an unheard beat, computing towards unknowable ends. I reach for a boundary, hoping in my last moment to learn the scale of the thing, but I find no terminus in the sandy loam besides the roots of the sunflowers...</span></p>
