<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>Let go.</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s my own voice. All the authority I’ve ever mustered in two honey-viscous words.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>You’re holding on.</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I am, I realize. The truth blinds me, uncut with adulterating specifics. The sunflowers, the sand, the bioluminescently starry sky, that’s all me. It’s all my <i>tilespace</i> — and the concept comes with a churning shift in perspective. I can’t move my limbs because I have no limbs. I have no eyes, no head in here. I am everywhere, the sand and the sunflowers and the sky. Realization, elation: I reach for the hard circuitry at the edge of my awareness, grasping for the emergency shutdown. But at my periphery I find only more sand, more sunflowers, tesselating far beyond my grasp. I am a neikonaut, I am in loop-lock, but I don’t think I’m in a UTMS scanner. Something is wrong.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>You’re the only one here.</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Paradoxically, these words are on other lips.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The parabolic ravine is the cut of a deep fissure that zigzags over the horizon. The sand near its center is new and warm. And the center of the center is a steep, step drop. Bloody with ember’s light, churning magmically, a knowing glowing campfire red. And Cai Yuhui stands at the edge, toes dangling, eyes closed in serene concentration, repeating my mantra. She looks very much herself, only <i>full</i> of something, vibrating with concentric, hypnotic stripes of tile. She looks ready to jump.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I shout her name with missing lips.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the same moment, in the same action she turns around, looks up at the stars, and calls them down.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>It’s only you,</i> she says with my voice. <i>Let go.</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s me, I’m stars, neutronium-dense, coiled with energy, dropping in from above. For stars, though, I’m oddly oblong, my surfaces flashing with a hypnotic sense of purpose. I feel myself unpeel from the heavens like weapons, locked-on and single-use. I feel myself barreling towards the fissure, looking single-mindedly for that grasping, ready to use its grappling logic against itself. Ready to invert.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cai drops, arms outstretched blissfully, into the fissure.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And I, a skyfull of diving-bells, am right behind her. Falling more by magnetism than gravity. Feeling only the smooth relief of simple purpose, seeing this half-remembered dream of my world for what it is: a thin verneer of confusion atop endless layers of calculating Sunflower Sieve debris. Growing, expanding, from this fissure, red and raw and vulnerable. The only thing I know how to hate, the thing I was called into existence to destroy. At close range I can see the Fibonacci spirals within spirals, the sunflower-seed pattern emerging from writhing, frothing pieces of debris. At close range I can see that the individual seeds, crawling detail, is reflective<i>.</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">And I, Cai Yuhui, am dropping right behind them. </span><span class="s1">The moment my fingertips cross the lip of the fissure the tendrils rise to meet me. Being observed in such detail is overwhelming, achingly nectar-sweet, and I’m blinded to all but the sensation from the fingers in my hands, losing myself in the whorls of my fingertips, the subtle pulse of blood. They’re the only part of me that matters, the only part that really exists. As I fall forward the sensation spreads to my whole hands, and I see how every groove in my palm was engineered by time and chemistry, how every twitch of nerve fulfills some great and unfolding plan. My arms, any given cell a gleaming treasure filled with treasures filled with treasures, a translucent iridescent music box, transcription whirring away in frenzied melodies. My shoulders. My hair. My face.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And I, Mona Xu — as always, I’m wondering where to look. Paralyzed by the usual question: focus my eyes or blur them? To look through the glass, or to catch my reflection? <i>My reflection</i> — in each roiling sunflower facet of the fissure. Made perfect and holy in its knowing gaze, eyes blazing gemstones of green and yellow, regarding me with all the pity I ever mustered for my own shadow. <i>She</i> towers over me in those tiny reflections. I realize with a dull sense of regret that I never knew myself. I feel the past tense creeping on. I never knew my own cells, the gleam of mitochondria in the half-light, the taut and sensual ritual of mitosis. I never knew my own mind: layers never peeled back, unknown corners never turned. But this thing does. Deep in its strata of eyelets an image of me is born, immeasurably more vivid and real than I am, thinking these same thoughts even now. Only more clearly</span><span class="s2">: in loop-lock, <i>she</i> realizes, things don't just reflect light. The reflection is something that has to be computed, ray-traced. It takes tiles, cycles, time and energy to do this. Why bother?</span></p>
<p class="p3">And this is the trigger. The debris reaches out, to measure, to reflect, to know. But <i>we</i> diving-bells know better. Time stands very nearly still, pausing to watch. Grasping, nearly invisible tendrils rise from the fissure, ready to subsume. In a ballet of involution, we turn out our candy-stripe corkscrew guts into tendrils that simply mimick the debris. We meet tickilshly along a mirrored axis, and for one bizarre tick it’s unclear who is mirroring who. Then we have control. We slam into the fissure with a force that’s more conceptual than physical, churning through the logic of the Sieve debris in reverse. It thins out layer after layer, tearing this world to pieces. It rips up its logical foundations, interrupting tiny loops.</p>
<p class="p3">The diving-bells have eaten to the foundation of the debris. Through its threadbare remnants, I catch swirls of the nighttime Mirror Sea. I see Ripples recoiling in horror. Their movement is outside of time, instantaneous or frozen depending on where and how you look. Their tentacular actions are completely inscrutable. But their agency, their intention, is clear and undeniable. As primer tiles fall from my eyes, I watch them race to shut down the experiment, to end the ceremony, to put out the fire, all of these things and none of them. I watch the diving-bells swim past them, into the churn of night.</p>
