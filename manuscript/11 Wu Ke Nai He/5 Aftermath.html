<p class="p1">And then I hit the filthy nightclub floor.</p>
<p class="p1">I hit my head hard enough that the Ripples dancing in quasigrams across the ceiling go blurry. But I can still see their panic, their dance interrupted by manic reaction. And part of me knows that if they’re panicking, it can only, inevitably be because we are too. Dimly I’m aware that the footwork around me has lost rhythm and gained direction. A crush of people, pushing away from my immediate area. <span class="s1">The simple <i>whump-whump-whump</i> of the bassline yields ground to a strange syncopation of clicks and whines, which crescendo and — after a DJ manages to break the feedback loop with the dance floor — flatten into a sustained and ominous drone.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Tethi has me by the shoulders, pulls me to my shaking feet.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“Did you see any of that?” I blubber, gesturing frantically to the quasigrams. My cheeks feel thick. My feet feel two hundred feet from my eyes. Something clicks in my memory, and I gesture to the rollscroll tucked under his arm. “Did you get that on the ’specs?”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“Mona, you hit your head, you —” He steadies me as I wobble, scutinizing my eyes. “Are you on something?”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“There’s an autovial,” I manage. “Forget that. Did you...did you see what the debris did?”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“<i>Fuck.</i>” And Tethi’s not looking at me. He’s looking around. “<i>Fuck fuck fuck</i>.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Plenty of times I’ve seen someone cause a scene by taking a spill in the club. But from Tethi’s frenetic glances, I realize that I’m not the star of this particular show. We’re in the middle of a growing hole in the crowd, only no one but he is paying me any attention at all. Everyone else is </span><span class="s3">fleeing the deep innards of Wu Ke Nai He.</span></p>
<p class="p1">“Teth, what’s going on?”</p>
<p class="p1">“The girl — that you were following?” I can see the way he’s coming back into his own eyes. “They took her.”</p>
<p class="p1">“<i>They</i> took her?”</p>
<p class="p1">But as the last of the DMT is metabolized, I realize that I<i> </i>saw it happen. A single strobe-struck memory, a single dropped frame. Three Chalkers, three pairs of ghostly hands, grabbing Cai and pulling her, <i>dragging</i> her, into the velvet labyrinth of Wu Ke Nai He. I struggle with a tighht double-knot: this real memory, and my image of Cai dropping into that awful fissure. She looked...blissful. I don’t want to believe it, but I can’t get that smile out of my head.</p>
<p class="p1">With a <i>thwunk</i>, the house lights go on. Which is not to say that it’s very bright at all, but even this twenty-watt bronze dimness is enough to drown out the Ripples on night-vision cameras, to reveal the finite shape of the room we’re in, to cast the terror on Tethi’s face into clear, sweat-beaded relief. The music drops out, and now there’s only terrified clamor, and insistent, impending shouts.</p>
<p class="p1">“<i>Make way.” </i>Someone is carving a path through the crowd with a bullhorn. <i>“Stand aside.”</i></p>
<p class="p1">“This way, they <i>took</i> her!” The disbelieving shriek of a clubgoer, perhaps too shocked that the Chalkers would be so brazen on their home turf. There’s an inbound needling of fingers, a parting of the way towards the empty spot on the dance floor where Cai stood, maybe just ninety seconds before...</p>
<p class="p1">I can read from Tethi’s face that he feels that needling. He presses the rollscroll into my hand. “I’m sorry,” he whispers. “I’ll find you.” His back is already turned. He’s already melted into the crowd, in a single long stroke, in a way I could never manage. He’s already gone. And I feel a pair of hands on each of my arms — <i>not me, too</i> — but they come with the laser sight of a vialgun, the flashing of a badge, a different kind of trouble. The dazzling visors of Weather Bureau agents, unidentifiable and unmistakable.</p>
<p class="p1">One of them shouts, nearly spits, into my ear. “Are you Mona Xu?”</p>
<p class="p1">A formality that requires no response. Dimly I recognize my YINS ID photo glazing the inside of his visor.</p>
<p class="p1">“Am I under arrest?” I shout back. But I remember from last time that this is the wrong question. There’s the sting of voxelite around my wrists, the sting of something else, too, and suddenly I feel very tired. And so it feels like a mercy that the world would envelope me in this way, swaddling me in the same black velvet this whole place is made of, rocking me to sleep after a very, very long day. It envelopes me fully, and the house lights go out.</p>
