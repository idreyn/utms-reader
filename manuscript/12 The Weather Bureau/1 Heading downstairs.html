<body>
<p class="p1">The black curtain of the sedative recedes, into a high-pitched whirring, into a gyroscopically stabilized rumbling. I feel it in the sore part of my head, against thick foam padding. All signs pointing to a scanner bed, until my world tilts, hard. I’m in a veetle. But my head is too sore, my limbs too heavy, to angle for a view out the window. In the seat next to me is Tethi, strapped down and unmoving. I catch my own dazed expression in the glazed visors of the Weather Bureau agents. I can’t see their faces, but by the tilt of their helmets I can tell they’re talking about us, subvocalizing. A minute later Tethi stirs. Neither of us move, just bouncing blinks of acknowledgement off the sheen of those visors.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s one long, confusing moment, and then the craft sets down. The autovial they pressed into my arm blinks off, and within sixty seconds — counted off silently by the one across from me — I have my limbs again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“You, with me.”</p>
<p class="p1">“What about him?” I insist, lead-tongued, trying to point to Tethi. “I’m not going without him.”</p>
<p class="p1">“We need Mr. Okeme to show us his subnet access point.” Such transparency for a synthetic voice, amplified and glossy whispers. “It’s urgent that we locate the Sunflower Sieve egg in the Mirror Sea.”</p>
<p class="p1">“He doesn’t —” I begin. Tethi’s expression is inscrutable, illucid, still half under. I decide not to speak for him. “Then bring me along.”</p>
<p class="p1">Glances, subvox, the hint of a shrug. An extended pause. If they’re not actually phoning in this request, they’re making a bizarre show of pretending to do so. One of them turns to reply to me, and just then comes a banging on the outside of the veetle. I manage a peek through the porthole window and spy a ring of receding grey hair.</p>
<p class="p1">“We won’t lay a finger on him, Mona. You have my assurances.” The voice is muffled, dull, and yet still familiar. The door hisses and slides open, and Dr. Rui Zhang’s head peeks inside. “Just, please, come with me.”</p>
<p class="p1">A wobbly two steps down, a long last glance at half-sedated Tethi. I spin, trying to orient myself against the skyline and find that we’re in Dongtanglu, perched on top of YINS. <i>That’s</i> Building 1, gleaming dimly with primer tiles, which means that <i>this</i> is Building 6. Rui keys open the balcony door, that Cai had opened for me not so long ago.</p>
<p class="p1">“Dr. Rui,” I begin, but I don’t even know what else to add.</p>
<p class="p1">“One minute,” he insists, finger to his lips. When the elevator arrives, he taps a card to the console, and an unsettling new group of buttons appears in an unsettling place. He taps the lowest one, and we ride down farther than I knew YINS went, past the tunnels, past the parking garages, eight stories or more. All the while he taps his foot rapidly, clutching at his tablet, very much not here with me. His usual veneer of mild surprise is gone, revealed now as mere foothills to deep craigs of determination and rage. He says nothing when the door opens, but looks at me in an oddly comradely way, as though to imply, <i>we’re on.</i></p>
<p class="p1">On the other side it’s all-hours bright, echoing with keystrokes and shouted coordinates. Floating, or hovering, or dangling in the cavernous space is the largest fishbowl I’ve ever seen, not just in size but in scale. The Mirror Sea looks positively galactic, twinkling with thousands of interwoven wormways, spiraling around one another, doglegging into higher dimensions. Right now it’s a prop for a frantic argument — someone waves a laser pointer into the murk of the quasigram, and their colleague waves their arms in clear frustration. Then there’s a three-second wave of hush, an outrushing of noise, as the floor turns towards us. Dozens and dozens of faces, and how many do I half-recognize from the campus lunch rush? The colleague with the laser pointer, I realize now, is Yue Fang. Arms folded, she gives me an uneasy glance before fixing her eyes on Dr. Rui.</p>
<p class="p1">A man approaches us, descending the low, circular steps of what can only be some kind of command center. Balding in the front, remaining hair falling to his shoulders, a neglected body propped up by a well-cut suit. He's been a few years from retirement for a very long time. He and Rui share a kind of silent sigh: <i>this is how it’s gonna be</i>.</p>
<p class="p1">“Do you know who I am, Mona Xu?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Uh.” I accept his crushing, calloused handshake, seeking even a single familiar line in his face. “I don’t.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Good.” He seems to find humor in this. “That’s very good. I am Detective Ma Zhuming of the Shanghai Unified Police Department, Special Hallucinations Task Force.”</p>
<p class="p1">I state the obvious. “You’re the Weather Bureau.”</p>
<p class="p1">“For now, that’s close enough. Later on, you’ll see that it’s more complicated.” He turns to Rui and lowers his voice, though I can still hear him clearly. “They’ve begun to spoof her tracker. It’s showing up all over the city.”</p>
<p class="p1">As Rui curses furiously under his breath, Ma looks past me, noticing that we’re still the center of attention, and barks, “Do you want Cai Yuhui back or not? Back to your screens, all of you! We’ll have a goddamn meet-and-greet later.” And then he adds to me: “<i>Academics. </i>Freezing like raccoons. No offense.”</p>
<p class="p1">With a gesture, with long strides, he leads us circumfrentially towards a conference room. The keystrokes resume, but the tenor of conversation is entirely different, and not-so-furitive glances hit us from every angle. Part of me is looking for a familiar aspects in the bare indigo carpet and white finishings. <i>Is this place YINS?</i> Most of me is trying not to stare too hard at that giant fishbowl. There’s every reason to believe it combines every camera in every ward under Blue Delta’s direct control. That could be almost half the entire Mirror Sea. At this scale there are patterns, symmetries, concentricities that I never imagined. A visceral tug invites me to look harder, see more...</p>
<p class="p1">“In here.” Ma opens a door. “Your advisor will be here soon. Coffee, tea...?”</p>
<p class="p1">My mouth opens, but I hardly hear what comes out. Ma makes a cheerful little salute and strides away, his long coat swishing. <i>My advisor?</i> For a while Dr. Rui and I sit side-by-side at a long conference table. A bleary, awkward silence. Several times he falls just short of speaking.</p>
<p class="p1">“I am sorry that we sedated you. It was a rash decision from the heat of the moment, seconds after we lost Cai.”</p>
<p class="p1">I have <i>so</i> many questions. The one that bubbles up is: “What happens to Tethi? Where is he, really?”</p>
<p class="p1">Rui fishes for words. “The truth is,” he begins slowly, “your friend is tonight’s bycatch. He was on a shortlist of suspects who were peddling the Sunflower Sieve, and the Bureau would have caught up with him in a few days if they didn’t nab him at Wu Ke Nai He. Assuming that he didn’t leak the egg to destroy his own monopoly, that makes two parties who located it before our own people did. We’re not on top of the Sea like we should be.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Respectfully, Dr. Rui, that’s not an answer to my question.”</p>
<p class="p1">He smiles sidelong. “What happens to Mbetethi is in large part up to him. The Weather Bureau’s purview begins and ends with managing the shoreline of the Mirror Sea. It considers grudges and long memories to be operational blinders, and detainees to be enormous liabilities. If your friend cooperates with our request for basic information about his Mirror Sea feeds, he’ll be free tonight.”</p>
<p class="p1">“But you’ll take it from him. You’ll, y’know, destroy his business.” My heart beats in my throat. I’m finding it hard to be civil.</p>
<p class="p1">“Less likely than you think. This is a skeleton crew, Mona. This is a very big city. The Bureau’s biggest asset is a deep footprint in the public imagination. In reality, it tolerates what it can, and prefers turning adversaries into allies. It rarely involves itself in the interward legalities of petty feed-splicing cases such as these. It rarely involves itself in anything at all, except when pivotal action is necessary.”</p>
<p class="p1">My mind reels back, a year and change: It was two agents in those mirrored visors — maybe the same two — who dragged me out of my flat, out of the depths of quadratic delusion, at the waterlogged end of my Ripplechasing stint. Had <i>that</i> been so important? And why? Rui, leaning back in his swivel chair, arms folded, regards me with an open, clear, curiosity. Then, to my surprise, he reaches into his slingbag and produces Tethi’s rollscroll. Gestures at the lock screen and smiles tenatively.</p>
<p class="p1">I show him the passcode. Seems like there’s nothing to lose.</p>
<p class="p1">“This is very good work,” he mutters, after a solid few minutes inspecting our data in silence. “What did you use?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Introspecs. Retooled a little. You know, Tethi did most of this.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Rui chuckles approvingly. And I feel uneasy, selling him on Tethi’s aptitude. In all Rui’s been saying to me, I’ve felt a subtle <i>click, click, click</i>, already ratcheting me into the position of Weather Bureau asset. In my inertia, exhaustion, dissociation, I’ve been slow to move out of the way. But would Tethi, once a Chalker, cooperate with the Bureau?</p>
<p class="p1">On the other hand, he did say he wanted to be at YINS.</p>
<p class="p1">Rui rolls up the screen, and again to my surprise, he hands it over to me. “You should be enormously proud of having figured this out for yourself, despite —”</p>
<p class="p1">The door flies open, and there she is. Dr. Deng. YINS sweatshirt over her pajamas, hair frazzled. Her glare barely singes me on the way to Dr. Rui.</p>
<p class="p1">“<i>Rui Zhang!</i>” The only word for what she’s doing is shouting. “<i>What are you doing with my student?</i>”</p>
<p class="p1">Big Ma Zhuming sets four steaming mugs on the table and gingerly closes the door behind them. Rui stands, mustering what I several is many decades of quiet defiance in keeping his voice firm and level.</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s over, Deng. Cai Yuhui disappeared on a field inversion tonight, and Mona was there measuring intersubjective convergence. It’s far past time that we bring her into the loop.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Disappeared? As in...”</p>
<p class="p1">“Into the Chalk.”</p>
<p class="p1">I don’t know exactly what he means by <i>intersubjective convergence</i>, but it seems like a bad time to bring that up. Suddenly, impossibly, Deng strides over to me and squeezes me into the boniest imaginable hug. “You can still just go home, Mona,” she’s muttering into my ear. “Just tell them you want to go home.”</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>I wriggle against her arms. “What haven’t you been telling me? What is going on?”</p>
<p class="p1">“It was for your own good.” There’s something low and crawling and strange in her voice that I don’t like at all. “You were better off not getting involved in this, and you still are. All I ever wanted for you was a normal Ph.D, and you can still have it. Just tell them you want to leave, to go home...”</p>
<p class="p1">But I push her off me, disgusted. “You’re the Weather Bureau?”</p>
<p class="p1">“<i>No!</i>” she insists. “<i>They</i> are. I am trying to <i>fix</i> the problem, they’d rather drown in it...”</p>
<p class="p1">“We are cleaning up after your mistakes,” roars Rui, directing a finger downward at Deng. “We are doing the best we can without the one person who could actually make a difference!”</p>
<p class="p1">“Dr. Deng, Dr. Rui, please.” Ma Zhuming insists, stepping between the two professors now almost literally at each others’ throats. “Let’s sit down. Let’s start from the beginning.”</p>
