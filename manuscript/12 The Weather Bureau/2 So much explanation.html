<p class="p1">The moment passes, leaving both of them with a slightly ruffled, undignified air. They’re still glowering, but I can sense some of their usual icy mutual respect has returned.</p>
<p class="p1">“Do you mind if I just start?” Rui asks, casually deferrential, across the table.</p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, by all means.” Deng is settling into an sarcastic, detatched version of herself that I don’t recognize at all. “Tell us how it goes.”</p>
<p class="p1">Ma, smiling at them in turn, seems to interpret this exchange as progress. Rui clears his throat and begins: “What you need to understand at the beginning is that there are gaps in this story that your advisor is perfectly capable of filling for us. But for the past three years, she has outright refused to do so.”</p>
<p class="p1">“That’s right,” Deng agrees blithely.</p>
<p class="p1">“Despite the fact that this was a condition embedded in our offer of a professorship at YINS.”</p>
<p class="p1">“If that’s how you see it,” she puts in.</p>
<p class="p1">“Just so we’re on the same page,” Rui sniffs. “Mona, think back to Xia Zitian’s resignation speech. It’s just a few minutes long, and he uses all that time to admit one basic thing: that the Mirror Sea governance engine never worked. That all of its decisions had, basically, been his own.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Okay. Sure.”</p>
<p class="p1">“All of the details come from the Xia Papers that appeared a few days later. It documented its abuse of public trust, its fraudulent misallocation of funds, the frayed ends of some weirder ambitions. It was just what Blue Delta was looking for: a way to shed its skin as a builder of seawalls and stormwater basins and become a legitimate opposition force. It seemed natural that they’d wield the Papers against the Communist Party, so no one thought very hard about where they came from.” He pauses for a sip of coffee. “They were handed by Dr. Deng to myself in the Fudan University neikotics lounge.”</p>
<p class="p1">“And you’re fucking welcome for that,” Deng spits.</p>
<p class="p1">“I wasn’t the only Blue Delta sympathizer at Fudan. Not even in the neikotics department, which was all Xia money. He and Deng got close in their Navy days, and he dropped her in our midst to lead us out of the fog. You have to credit this woman for cracking loop-lock,” Rui insists. “But a few years after that, just as she and I were making some progress on safety, Xia plucks her back out. If she can fix the psychedelic brain computer interface, well, maybe she can fix the homomorphically encrypted surveillance state. Sure, fine, she’ll be missed.” Something twists in Rui’s voice, the way it does near the end of campfire stories. “Only she starts coming back for her stuff. She starts gutting the Bridge project, taking little pieces with her to the Mirror Sea command center. She starts bleeding Fudan for its best neikonauts. A big crew of neikonauts. And she won’t say why.”</p>
<p class="p1">I keep waiting for Deng to break her pursed-lip silence and protest some detail.</p>
<p class="p1">“Even the Xia Papers didn’t say why. She gave up her boss, but she wrote herself and her neikonauts out of the story. It was pretty clean. I could tell that something had been cauterized away, but Blue Delta was storming city hall, and the cameras were coming down, and I was too elated to care. It came to me in fragments, reading between the lines of those reports, that she did succeed in building one Deng Bridge, and probably many others. I had a vague, strange sense that the Big Three were attracting most of the city’s neikotic talent, and Deng’s crew weren’t popping up in their ranks. But Blue Delta’s was faltering, Shanghai was shattering into wards, and I was too exhausted to care.”</p>
<p class="p1">And Rui looks exhausted now. He looks over to Deng as though this time, the hundredth time, she might offer to tell the story as it really goes. She only eyes him coolly over the rim of her mug. Instead, Ma Zhuming picks up the slack.</p>
<p class="p1">“I was Xia’s eyes inside the police,” Ma begins. He has a voice built and honed for briefings. “I was his confidant; I thought I was his best friend. I was personally devastated when the papers came out. We spoke twice before his trial, and here’s what’s funny. Here’s where I should have seen it coming. I used our last precious minutes together asking about the creatures living in the Mirror Sea. The Papers had stills, some video, and a hundred behavioral reports. But I wanted more. I <i>kept pressing him</i>. What was it like to see one up close? What did you really learn from watching them?”</p>
<p class="p1">He pauses, I think, so that we all feel the tug. The biggest fishbowl I’ve ever seen is just outside. And Deng, Rui, Ma, and me, none of us are all here. We’re all silently itching to go watch it.</p>
<p class="p1">“Blue Delta paid attention to the wrong part of the Xia Papers,” he concludes. “They — we — imagined the public horrified by lies about what the computer system was capable of, what it had managed to build beneath the city as its logic unraveled. We staked everything on that. But what the public really cared about was the Ripples. They — we — were fascinated. Smitten. No one should have been surprised when people started putting the cameras back up.”</p>
<p class="p1">And thus, the Weather Bureau. Neither Rui or Ma ever own their allegiance to it. They speak about it like a third party, talking circles around how it came to be: from strands of the police force, and Blue Delta’s bureaucracy, and academia. The municpal weather bureau was a convenient cloak: harmless, nonpartisan, a footprint in every ward. As another world bloomed openly on screens across Shanghai, it consumed their expertise in fluid dynamics and predictive modeling. Ripplechasing. The Chalkers. Quadratic belief — or, if you like, mass psychosis, collective delusion. People were hallucinating more in the Sea than the poor weathermen knew what to do with. The thing outgrew its carapice.</p>
<p class="p1">Its new shell was YINS.</p>
<p class="p1">It was built on top of the old Mirror Sea command center.</p>
<p class="p1">“Easier than you’d think,” Rui chuckles. “To weave something like this into a research university. No one really understands what other people are working on. These days, we barely understand our own work.”</p>
<p class="p1">This is where I really start to dig in with questions. I ask over and over again what came first. Did the Weather Bureau infiltrate YINS, <i>found</i> YINS, because it had begun to find neikotic eggs in the Sea? Or had that come after, when more of the observation was done from loop-lock? Neither Rui or Ma can really say. Deng takes a smirking pleasure in watching them squirm, her point seemingly made.</p>
<p class="p1">“Suowei — I believe, I’d have to check — was the first to find a neikotic egg in the hyperlagmites. It contained nothing. It was like a seashell on the beach. Pick it up, and hear the ocean. But it undeniably had the form. Months later, they found a second one. It had some minor algorithmic utility. Suowei started quietly buying up Mirror Sea feeds. Paracoin and Chaoyue blindly followed, for years, before they caught on to the why.”</p>
<p class="p1">Between Suowei and the other fintechs, there are a few dozen people looking for eggs in the Sea. Their people don’t talk each other, but they do talk to the Weather Bureau. They — and YINS — have ways to launder those discoveries as human. Rui says that the Hall of Eggs is filling up with discoveries pulled from the Sea, secreted into the workstreams of YINS researchers. These techniques are nearly seamless. It is very nearly as though the researchers are making the discoveries themselves. And who among them, coming out of loop-lock, could possibly know otherwise?</p>
<p class="p1">“We started finding groundbreaking stuff in there. We saw a small fraction of the Ripples frequenting the hyperlagmites, and we began to follow them to parts of the Mirror Sea that no one knew existed. In some cases, we had to put up more cameras to get a good look at what they were doing. The only problem is that the debris.”</p>
<p class="p1">Enter Rui Zhang, soberware expert. Enter Cai Yuhui, expert permeator of the boundary between the neikotic elite and the Chalk. Enter Mona Xu, the unwitting hidden partner, churning out inversions. It was becoming routine: Cai would learn one of my inversions by heart, keeping it on ice in a slippery, melting bed of soberware, and deploy it into a crowd full of neikonauts like at Wu Ke Nai He. If you can believe that the Ripples bounce from mind to mind, if you can believe that their creations are</p>
