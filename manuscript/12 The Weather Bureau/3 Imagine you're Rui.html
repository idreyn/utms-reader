<p class="p1">Imagine you’re Dr. Rui Zhang. You’re a tall guy, grew up playing basketball. At Fudan University, age thirty-five, you’d walk past a disused parking lot where the maintenance department had chalked out a narrow half-court. You’d see them playing on your lunch break and theirs, their blue coveralls piled in the grass. Fast-paced, choppy three-on-three. You’d slow down, watch with a friendly curiosity. Finally you worked up the nerve to ask to play. And hey, your jump shot was still there! You came back the next day and the next, convincing yourself that there was fundamentally nothing <i>weird</i> about this, that it was just what people did.</p>
<p class="p1">Some of them had ironed these blue triangle patches on the sleeves of their coveralls. Blue Delta. The megaproject architects, the switchgrass planters, the cherry-picker double-parkers, picking trash with pikes in the park. The whole organization was conceived as bait to keep certain crabs in a City Hall-shaped bucket, and boy did they take it. Malingering in the middle rungs of party-state politics, something began to brew. It sold stickers to Fudan students with working-class affectations. It sponsored parks and paid pensions. It had a weirdly large following on doujiang. And increasingly, it had opinions about Shanghai Party Secretary Xia Zitian and all the special cameras he was putting up.</p>
<p class="p1">“Why on earth are we installing a redundant fiber-optic network? Why are we picking up trees and replanting them ten feet away? Because that’s what the <i>cameras</i> say to do?” This is one of your new pals talking. He’s a ventilation technician with a mean crossover and a conspiratorial bent. “And let’s be honest. Who knows how much those things are really seeing?”</p>
<p class="p1">You want to argue. All those clickbait teardown videos never turned up a single camera without the anonymizing hash-lens. Xia’s approach is weird, but it’s only an experiment, and you like those. But you always assumed that Blue Delta itself had been responsible for all that municipal make-work; you didn’t realize how much of it was handed to them by the Mirror Sea. Later, you read up on it. You learn how the Lam-Waldmann Hash compresses Shanghai into a web of isomorphisms: not trash bins or speeding cars or robberies, but looser abstractions lurking behind all these. <i>Simpler to understand, once you see them.</i> You watch clips of Xia Zitian explaining it like a stabilizing gyroscope on the wobbly bike of ambitious central planning. You start to wonder about the whole thing.</p>
<p class="p1">But, up in the lab, Xia Zitian just handed you a winning lottery ticket. His interest in Fudan’s brain-computer interface project is hardly a secret, but few people know how poorly it was going until Xia personally injected one of his acolytes (his <i>goons</i>, you joke) in the form of Dr. Deng Jinghan. Her throwaway ideas from day one are publishable results in category theory. By day four, she’s picked you as her ally. She pulls you into a utility closet and your heart cartwheels — you’re a married man! — but she produces a big vape, a muti-chambered thing ripped from a taikonaut’s spacewalk toolbelt. You frown: you’ve been trying to kick nicotine.</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s not nicotine.” She laughs, but you can see she’s nervous too. “It’s DMT.”</p>
<p class="p1">You, mister lead neuroscientist, make a big show of knowing all about it.</p>
<p class="p1">“Smoke this,” she says. “Take three big hits. Hold the last one in for as long as you can.”</p>
<p class="p1">Subjectively, you die. Subjectively, your brain is ripped from your skull and launched superluminally into a gallery-parade of higher-order differential forms radiating divinity, a Bezier-curve bubble-gum pantheon of babbling, computronium trophies that Team Universe won just for being born. <i>Zai lai yi tang</i>, they sing on your way down. <i>Come again!</i> You realize that objectively, you’re lying on a makeshift recliner of cardboard boxes and mop heads. Objectively. You don’t know what that word means any more.</p>
<p class="p1">“They’re never going to go for it,” you insist through the afterglow. But <i>wow</i>! This little molecule lifts the brain’s raw computing power into conscious experience. It gets you ninety percent of the way there. “It’s illegal, Dr. Deng. It’s...it’s insane.” Are you going to tell your wife? How could you not?</p>
<p class="p1">“<i>He</i> will. And that’s all that matters.”</p>
<p class="p1">Within a month you have IRB approval to run trials with DMT. Things move fast with Xia on your side.</p>
<p class="p1">Within a year you crack loop-lock. One of your test pilots finally slams into the computer the right way and passes on through. In seconds he breaks out of the scanner VM, enters the building’s network, and flashes a victory message with the lights. No one thinks Deng’s little word, <i>neikonaut</i>, is silly after that.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">* * *</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p1">You feel the years passing most acutely in your right hip, which is suddenly not what it used to be. But you still come to the court to shoot around. Some of the maintenance guys are happier with Xia Zitian’s reforms now. <i>The city just works better now</i>, one of them insists. Poverty, crime, traffic: the curves all bend in the right direction, and Blue Delta is fighting it out of spite. The opposing argument is now that <i>Blue Delta is going through the motions.</i> It’s rubber-stamp controlled opposition, a drowned island of quiet human competence. They all agree it no longer stands for people like them. Its political character has changed.</p>
<p class="p1">You frown, and decide not to mention your role in this.</p>
<p class="p1">Blue Delta’s megaprojects need public-private partnerships, and those need fundraisers, and <i>those</i> need Fudan University luminaries roving around, drink in hand. As one such gala winds down, a woman named Kang Yimou pulls you aside. In a whirlwind of irony and indirection, a question. <i>If it comes down to it</i>, she wants to know — and no one is saying it will — where would the Fudan faculty tend to land? With Blue Delta, or the Communist Party of China?</p>
<p class="p1">You’ve been handed a fair few drinks tonight, and you go off on a tangent.</p>
<p class="p1">You explain that Xia Zitian has a personal interest in your work. You explain who Deng is, what the project is, and smirk when Kang’s eyes widen. <i>Yeah, it works.</i> It works so well that it’s leaving bits of the computer in its users’ minds. Addressing that problem is your priority, and it’s supposed to be Deng’s too.</p>
<p class="p1">But recently, Deng’s barely been showing up for work. Mostly at odd hours, and sometimes with a huge duffel bag. When you <i>really </i>press her, she admits she’s begun consulting for Xia’s other pet project: the Mirror Sea camera system. She won’t tell you what she’s doing there. She certainly won’t tell you what they’re seeing in there. With unusual sharpness, she asks you to <i>stop asking about it</i>. As a professional courtesy.</p>
<p class="p1">“The thing is,” you tell Kang. “She’s taking parts of her machine with her. I think she’s building one for him.”</p>
<p class="p1">Your sound crazy. Your words slur at the edges. But Kang is hanging on to every word.</p>
<p class="p1">“You mean the transcranial scanner thing?”</p>
<p class="p1">“That’s <i>our</i> machine. <i>Her</i> machine connects two of those scanners together. She calls it a neikotic bridge. We call it the Deng Bridge, which she <i>hates</i>...”</p>
<p class="p1">“And what’s that for?” Kang asks, all too casually.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">You swore her to secrecy, but you know she might as well be recording. So you back off from the edge, and give her Deng’s crisp stock answer: “What’s the internet for?”</p>
<p class="p1">Kang Yimou knows an asset when she sees one. She gives you her WeChat ID and implores you to contact her if you find out anything else. Something rankles about putting this strange woman’s contact in your phone — you’re a married man! — and you store the digits in the few kilobytes of soberware rattling around in the front of your mind. But even for its inventor, the soberware barely works. The next morning it’s gone, replaced with a pounding headache.</p>
<p class="p1">Nevertheless, a few weeks later, Kang finds your work email.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><i>So. Got anything for me?</i></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">* * *</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Eighteen months later, you’re still trying to get soberware to click for even a single test subject. One such frustrating day, a postdoc bursts onto the lab floor with news.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Xia Zitian is stepping down!”</p>
<p class="p1">“<i>Shhhh.</i>” You gesture to the subject in the scanner. “Wait, what?”</p>
<p class="p1">Once you shook Xia’s hand when he visited the lab: he was tall, handsome, impeccably dressed in a coal-black suit and a red tie. In the video, at the podium, stands that man’s hollowed-out husk. He’s improvising, circling his point, but finally he admits it: the Mirror Sea’s recommendation system, the large language model behind the cameras, never<i> </i>really worked. It lost coherence years ago, and Xia’s office is passing off their own observations as the computer’s work. He can’t allow this to continue, he’s very sorry, and he’s stepping down.</p>
<p class="p1">You’re not so surprised. The fight has been taken behind the thick red curtain, but Blue Delta never stopped calling hearings, demanding a paper trail, trying to untangle the process behind the neat little policy briefs that Xia’s mountain of GPUs puts out daily. Your colleague is the only other Blue Delta sympathizer in the lab, and there’s accelerant in his voice when he wonders, “What happens next?”</p>
<p class="p1">You frown, silent. You’re still stuck on that word, <i>observations</i>.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">No one knows what happens next. Xia Zitian was China’s heir apparent, and the golden braid connecting Shanghai to Beijing has snapped. After the press conference, he got into a black car and simply went home. At nine sharp on Monday, two forces show up at his front door to arrest him. One is from the national Ministry of Public Security. The other is harder to describe: it’s a volunteer detachment of the Shanghai police department, only it’s wearing uniforms no one’s seen before. An inverted blue triangle on their shoulders, vastly overstepping their authority. They’re quaking in their boots. But the man who led them there is not. In lieu of a firefight, a brief conversation: Ma Zhuming steps forward, exchanges charged words with Xia and the MPS. It’s crazy, but through a telephoto lens, it looks like they’re giving <i>him</i> the decision. In the end, Xia surrenders not to his country but to his city.</p>
<p class="p1">For Blue Delta, the clock starts now. They’ve made their move, they have Xia in custody, but the tide of public support is hardly rising behind them. The city is too calm, the protests too scattered, their ire too focused on the cameras themselves. Two days pass: the public is reading Blue Delta’s big move as an interbureaucratic mixup. They’re joking that Xia is the most honest politician in the city’s history. Blue Delta’s problem is that Xia’s confession was too light on details. It was barely clear what he admitted to. If they don’t find something specific — something to help people understand why they should be upset — this whole thing might just blow over.</p>
<p class="p1">Kang Yimou messages you morning and night. <i>What do you know? Where are you? Have you heard from Deng?</i> Blue Delta’s people are supposed to be out in force, organizing protests, hanging blue-triangle banners from the lampposts. But they’re chickening out. The PLA is cruising around in jeeps and parking them in front of City Hall. <i>It’s starting to feel like a seige here,</i> Kang writes. But at the end of the day, your only connection to Blue Delta is a few chats on a burner phone. You’re grateful to be at home with your wife, watching this play out incoherently on CCTV. Part of you hopes it blows over. You don’t want to see Kang in prison — but the cameras are probably going to come down either way. Isn’t that what Blue Delta wanted? Why do they want <i>this</i>, too?</p>
<p class="p1">You’re brushing your teeth when the doorbell rings. It’s Deng. It’s the first you’ve seen of her in six months.</p>
<p class="p1">“You’re with Blue Delta,” she says. It’s a question, but it’s not. “You’ve been working with them.”</p>
<p class="p1">You glance up the stairwell to your wife, who looks ready to fillet whoever rang at this hour.</p>
<p class="p1">“You don’t have to admit it,” Deng continues. She sounds winded, walking around with that huge camping bag. It looks like her entire life is on her shoulders. “No one is coming for you. But I’m going to hand you <i>this</i>, and I need you to get it to whoever’s in charge at Blue Delta.” And she presses an external hard drive the size of a brick into your hands.</p>
<p class="p1">“What —” you begin.</p>
<p class="p1">“A dump of the Mirror Sea archives. The project from top to bottom. The public deserves to know and...” she pauses for a deep breath. “Those cameras need to come down and stay down. Can Blue Delta do that? Can...can you do this for me, Rui? As a professional courtesy?”</p>
<p class="p1">There’s no taxi, no black car. She just walks away into the night.</p>
<p class="p1">One of your wife’s many endearing qualities is her paranoid cybersecurity posture. If she had her way, the breakfast nook would be Faraday cage. She unplugs routers and smart bulbs before she lets you connect Deng’s drive to an old laptop. <i>The project from top to bottom.</i> It spills onto the screen, hundreds of top-level folders. The question hangs in the air: where on earth to start?</p>
<p class="p1">You know what you want to know. You feel manic, triumphant, and very barely sorry for Dr. Deng and her camping pack and wherever she’s going next. You’re not thinking at all about how you’ll get the drive to Kang Yimou, or what she’ll do with it, or what it’ll do to Shanghai. You punch Deng’s name into the search bar. Your wife raises an eyebrow, but she gets it, she wants to know too. The old laptop growls as it indexes terabytes of data. You brew some tea, finish it; the progress bar has hardly moved. You fall asleep slumped against each other on the couch.</p>
<p class="p1">A few hours before dawn, you stir, paw around for your glasses. The index is complete.</p>
<p class="p1">In almost 40 terabytes of files, <i>0 results for Deng Jinghan.</i></p>
<p class="p1">You smile, feeling more kindess for Deng than you have in years. You <i>know</i> her; you know that she’s even more afraid of the limelight than of criminal prosection. You would be too. Of course she’d write herself out of the story, cauterize away her own role. And she’s probably done a masterful job. She’s probably been running transformers on it for days, making sure the seams are invisible to everyone but you. You try a few more queries.</p>
<p class="p1"><i>0 results for loop-lock.</i></p>
<p class="p1"><i>0 results for ultrafine transcranial magnetic stimulation.</i></p>
<p class="p1"><i>0 results for neikotic bridge.</i></p>
