<p class="p1">Imagine you’re Ma Zhuming.</p>
<p class="p1">Now imagine your nephew shaved off half right your eyebrow. Sorry! His older brother cuts hair, so he wanted to cut hair, so you let him freshen up your crew cut. The trimmer slipped, and, well. Preferable to an eyepatch, barely. You stand in the mirror and hold up these objects in succession: a Sharpie, a ballcap, a pair of sunglasses. But there’s nothing for it. At any rate, nobody at the precinct is going to come over to the boss’ desk to give you a hard time. You arrive to scattered double-takes at eight sharp. You catch a few glances and snickers in the break room.</p>
<p class="p1">“What?” You goad them on, half-smiling. “What’s funny over there?”</p>
<p class="p1">Shortly after ten the glances lengthen. Had there been a fucking <i>memo</i> about your eyebrows? There’s something strange about it, that’s for sure. And suddenly, half the floor is staring in your direction. It’s not just that they’re watching you; they’re waiting for you to do something.</p>
<p class="p1">“Enough,” you stand and shout, exasperated. “Yes, I am missing half an eyebrow! Get on with your work!”</p>
<p class="p1">This turns out not to be about your eyebrow. It’s about your best friend, Xia Zitian.</p>
<p class="p1">You turn on the TV.</p>
<p class="p1">The Mirror Sea was a nearly impossible sell for the police, once they realized that its cameras were replacing the ones you could actually <i>see</i> through, in order to solve robberies and murders and kidnappings. Xia had the luxury of trafficking in statistics; they dealt in individual deaths. But you made the sell, like you told him you would. And he was right. Crime is down thirty-two percent since the new cameras were installed. Now Zitian is up on the podium, saying <i>something</i> about the Mirror Sea — a knot in your throat, you don’t like this. Then your phone starts ringing. And ringing. They all want to know what you have to say. You had no idea. You thought you knew him.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, by the way, they want you to come along to arrest him.</p>
<p class="p1">“<i>Arrest </i>him?”</p>
<p class="p1">Yes. In three hours. The suspicion arises that there are factions jostling under your feet, that there are actually <i>two</i> plans to arrest your friend which both rely on your presence to keep him calm. This doesn’t bode well. You decide to go with the man who you trust more, even though he’s in Public Safety and you’re in Irregular Crimes. You muster in an alleyway and that’s when you see those blue triangles on their shirts.</p>
<p class="p1">“Boys.” You shake your head, scared for their sakes. “This isn’t the time.”</p>
<p class="p1">“<i>You’re</i> not in a position to tell us that,” one shouts back. This stops you in your tracks. Since you took the big job, you’d always insist that <i>you</i> worked for <i>them</i>: the juniors on the force, the lives on the line. That when time passed you by you wouldn’t obstruct it. Maybe this is just how that happens. <i>All right.</i> You sigh. <i>Let’s go</i>.</p>
<p class="p1">There is very nearly an altercation with the Ministry of Public Safety. But you step forward through the ranks and restore order, just like everyone said you would. It’s gotta be you who puts him in cuffs. Why, why, why didn’t he just tell you first? You search Xia’s face for an answer and see nothing you recognize. So you march him back to the van — into Blue Delta’s custody, you realize. You’ve made your choice, and you did it with half an eyebrow.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">* * *</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">You are Ma Zhuming, and your reputation as an honest and even-handed man is starting to get you in trouble. No one can quite imagine that you’d choose to throw in with the other side. You’re a hero to the Blue Delta boys now, although they quickly whisk Xia out of your sight. Meanwhile, back at your desk, there’s a call waiting from the national Ministry of Public Safety.</p>
<p class="p1">“Ma. Please help me understand the meaning of this.”</p>
<p class="p1">You recognize the satellite-phone harmonics from your Navy days, and you glance out the window, half-expecting to see this senior MPS official yammering into a great beige box. You know you’re not in trouble because he’s letting loose with his Beijing drawl, the same accent you have.</p>
<p class="p1">“They’re kids,” you reply slowly. “They’re having their moment. Blue Delta, it’s not so easy to explain, but they all grew up with it. It’s about pride for the city, which I think in our own way we understand.”</p>
<p class="p1">The brass still sees in you an overgrown Beijing hutong kid: they imagine that in their youth they threw rocks and nicked <i>binggunr</i> and scorned lovers on the same block as you. You’re one of Xia’s men, which makes you one of their men, which makes you their eyes and ears in Shanghai.</p>
<p class="p1">“Is this a threat to us, Ma?”</p>
<p class="p1">“That’s possible.” You consider your words. “But it’s a small explosion in a big box. Everyone here is feeling betrayed right now. I say, keep it slow and deliberate. Now that he’s someone’s custody, a handoff will go smoothly.”</p>
<p class="p1">You think you sound wishy-washy, but the man on the line sounds deeply reassured.</p>
<p class="p1">“Hrm. That’s quite right.” There’s springtime wind and grumbling on the other end. “I know this can’t be easy for you, knowing him best of all. Do us one favor, Ma, hang around headquarters for a few days and let us know if you see any more of those damned blue triangles.”</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">* * *</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Two days later, Blue Delta drops the Xia Zitian Papers. People who were merely confused before are really, properly mad now. In retrospect, there had<i> </i>been a moment some years ago where the Mirror Sea visibly went awry. It had watched Shanghai through nearly half a billion eyes and concluded, somehow, that what this city with dozens of subway lines and a new storm water system needed was more tunnels. More tunnels than there was space for, frankly. When the tunnel boring machines began to collide, Blue Delta demanded hearings. A rare peek behind the curtain: Xia’s team begrudgingly admitted that the Mirror Sea’s model of Shanghai was slightly…non-Euclidean. They were working on fixing it.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, years later, it turns out that they never did.</p>
<p class="p1">Blue Delta declares itself the legitimate governing authority in Shanghai. Now, it does not declare sovereignty or independence, nothing so full-throated or red-blooded. It has a hard time squeezing its nuanced, weasely demands onto the printed protest signs it distributes. The most bizarre images from these days clearly show Blue Delta cosplaying both sides of this revolution. Its provocateurs riling up moderate crowds, and its crowd-control forces marshaling them into narrow spaces so they look larger on TV. <i>We have been trying to tell you</i>, it insists. <i>We have been trying to warn you about Xia Zitian. Now turn to the camera, and tell Beijing to give us this chance.</i></p>
<p class="p1">You start to think, maybe they deserve it.</p>
<p class="p1">They’re holding him at City Hall, which is now Blue Delta’s base of operations. The strain of Blue Delta occupying that building are moneyed, politically savvy, and much more suspicious of you than your fellow cops, and it takes several days before they let you see him.</p>
<p class="p1">You were his most trusted advisor. In a bureaucracy full of yes-men, you were his old boot camp buddy, unafraid to tell him <i>hell no, get real</i>. You’d pass long nights scheming and bullshitting in his office, drinking whisky from teacups, your feet up on his grand mahogany desk. He’d take calls with the State Council with you rolling your eyes and shaking your head just out of frame. At the end of the day you were in Shanghai because Xia was in Shanghai. In five or ten years when they called him to Beijing to lead the nation, you’d be there too.</p>
<p class="p1">“<i>Why</i>, old friend?” You know Blue Delta is listening, and you don’t care. “You could have told me, I could have helped you. We could have found a way out of this together.”</p>
<p class="p1">His holding cell is a disused office. The desk is cheap metal, but you’ve taken your usual places on each side of it. Still, the usual twinkle in Xia’s eyes is gone. He stares through you. “I don’t regret keeping your hands clean,” he says softly. “The city needs the likes of you, and now you’ll have a part in whatever comes next. But it <i>was</i> selfish. We got carried away, and I stopped living in the real world. You were my last link to it. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p class="p1">You grimace. Ma Zhuming, on the verge of tears. What bothers you most is the <i>we</i>. You and who else got carried away, Xia? That scientist woman?</p>
<p class="p1">But you find you have other questions.</p>
<p class="p1">The Xia Zitian Papers are a disorganized twenty-eight terabytes, which would be a lot of paper indeed. But byte-for-byte, they’re mostly high-resolution images and videos of the crystaline hidden layers of the Mirror Sea’s neural networks, and the things they found bumping around in there. It took you a while to clock the Ripples in the footage, but now you can’t unsee them. You find yourself coming back to them again and again, mesmerized by their…is it wrong to call it <i>behavior</i>? Is it wrong to say they’re <i>living</i> in there? You can tell he doesn’t want to answer these questions, that he’s choking out answers as penance.</p>
<p class="p1">He makes it sound crazy. He wants to make you think he went crazy. But you see perfectly well how Xia thought that he could govern the city by learning to interpret the Ripples and their movements, and by trying to build them a good home. After all, the Ripples <i>are</i> the city. There is so much of Shanghai’s flavor and essence packed into their motion — you see it too. It’s just out of reach, somewhere just beyond words, but you know it’s there. For a dizzying instant you wish overwhelmingly that he had brought you along for the ride.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">At the end of your fifteen minutes, you tell him: “I understand.”</p>
<p class="p1">Xia only shakes his head sadly, and that’s your last image of him, until you’re called to testify at his trial. But years later, after the dust settles, after the Mirror Sea is dismantled, after Blue Delta gets its autonomous zone and the foundations of the city begin to collapse, it doesn’t surprise you at all when the cameras start to go back up.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">* * *</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>It’s a stupid name,</i> you think. You say so, to this Dr. Rui Zhang. But you misunderstand.</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s not called the Weather Bureau, Ma. It <i>is</i> the Weather Bureau.”</p>
<p class="p1">Almost immediately after gaining control of the city, Blue Delta lost hundreds of tiny battles at once. With Xia gone, it stood for very little in particular, and made too convenient an enemy for everyone. The Party’s loyalists, sure, but also its discontents, and plenty of less legible political inclinations. When the CCP finally withdrew, to spite Blue Delta as much as anything else, it <i>really</i> withdrew. Vast sheaves of social safety net disappeared beneath Shanghai’s feet, and Blue Delta discovered the hard way that infrastructure was not just roads and pipes. The wards appeared, fragmenting the map, to plug those gaps. These days, there is precious little functional government at the municipal level. Your job as a police subcommissioner is mostly to coax each ward’s private security, their redlights, into fighting crime instead of each other.</p>
<p class="p1">Apparently one municipal agency was so apolitcal, so non-threatening, that it survived the collapse of the social order unbothered. It has a good relationship with every ward, access to buildings throughout the city, and expertise in predictive modeling. Dr. Rui Zhang has burnt a lot of political capital to blackmail its bureau chief, which is not easy to do to a man who spends most of his time thinking about fluid dynamics. He has begun to install something inside the Shanghai Weather Bureau that will wear it like a cloak. He wants you to lead it, covertly, from within.</p>
<p class="p1">Half of the emergency calls you field these days are for psychosis. People are seeing things in those displays that shouldn’t be there. They’re losing track of their own whereabouts for days, months, or even years. It’s befalling people who have never touched a psychedelic in their lives, and crazy kids are even starting to seek it out. You don’t need to be convinced that there’s a problem, but it takes you years to grasp the shadow of what the problem actually <i>is</i>.</p>
<p class="p1">In time you learn that Rui Zhang is not a meteorologist but a neuroscientist, a neikologist. That his fascination with the Mirror Sea has the same kind of wretched personal bent as yours. That you both agree it needs regulation, but rarely agree on just what that means. Do you go after the street gangs that call themselves Chalkers? Do you insist on taking down the giant displays drawing tourism to the city to see the Ripples? Does it mean telling the triangle of giant financial firms issuing Shanghai’s new currency that they can’t start buying the feeds? The Weather Bureau must pick its battles carefully, appear much larger than it actually is. It must show its strength, or show nothing at all.</p>
<p class="p1">The people of Shanghai come to fear it. But if you ever doubt that what you’re doing is wrong, though, it’s because of the mirrored visors. Rui has his reasons, and they’re good ones, but you think your men should have to show their faces.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">* * *</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It looks like any other swirl in the Mirror Sea: nothing, then briefly something, and then nothing. Rui replays it over and over, pointing out its features, trying to put into words what about the shape in the Sea makes his neikotic channels tingle. You don’t see it.</p>
<p class="p1">“But <i>they</i> will,” he insists. “A neikotic egg is like candy for them. It’s pleasurable in its own right, like a brainteaser, but it can also be incredibly valuable.” He’s doing a bad job hiding his excitement. You realize that somewhere in that big head of his, he predicted this years ago and never told you. If you press him, he’ll tell you he didn’t want to speak it into existence, to distort consensus reality. But more likely he just didn’t think you’d understand.</p>
<p class="p1">You don’t understand.</p>
<p class="p1">The Weather Bureau has long outgrown its original skin, and the Yangtze Institute for Neikotic Studies was a pragmatic choice for its second host. For one, Rui is still a neikologist. He can finally stop splitting his time between Fudan University and the cluster of disused municipal buildings where the Bureau holes up. For another, the university is practically on top of the headquarters of Xia’s old Mirror Sea project. All the old fiber-optic runs right there. It’s too good a coincidence to pass up. You wonder about that a lot.</p>
