<p class="p1">Tethi and I share one lucid moment.</p>
<p class="p1">The velvet curtain lifts, resolving into shapes, but only barely. The sedative also blocks pattern recognition. Tethi’s pleasantly baffled expression, his mouth a tiny ‘o’,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>swims in the reflective visor of the Weather Bureau agent across from us. We trade a few blinks of mute acknowledgement, and then we’re banking again, and my eyelids are too heavy. We’re banking. I do, distantly, understand that we’re in a veetle. But the foam headrest feels like a Kanwei Glider’s, and I keep expecting tiles to come flashing into my eyes. <i>A veetle.</i> Years ago I let myself imagine my first veetle ride would be to the Tomorrow Evening gala, as a person of note in the neikotic sciences. What a joke.</p>
<p class="p1">But as the curtain comes down again, my last thought is that <i>we’re together, we’re safe together.</i> Tethi was taken; I gave myself up, but they’re going to deal with us as a pair…</p>
<p class="p1">My next peek through the curtain: the veetle is on rubber tires, on solid ground. They’re wheeling me out in a stretcher. My vision is all grey and rectangular, the angles mismatched, not worth the headache. But I can smell that we’re in a parking garage. Someone is here to receive us.</p>
<p class="p1">“And him?”</p>
<p class="p1">The voice inquiring after Tethi is male, calm, somehow familiar…</p>
<p class="p1">“We’ll get airborne, stop the drip, and start asking questions.” says the Weather Bureau agent in a slippery soap-bubble voice, subvox through synthesizer. “The old razzle-dazzle.”</p>
<p class="p1">The inquiring voice doesn’t fully approve of this, but I’m losing track of what it’s saying. It’s echoing in pieces against narrow walls and bright lights. I’m on the ground, and Tethi is back in the air. The velvet folds are so, <i>so</i> soft…</p>
<p class="p1">The curtain recedes for the last time, and now I am reclining against a familiar, sweat-stained foam. My nose, my limbs, and then my eyes confirm it. I really am in a scanner bed this time, only the hood is up and my head is free to move. Monitors clipped to my finger and taped to my shoulder: I remove these without even a thought. Vision is still shapes and color, but such familiar ones. It strikes me: this is the same model of scanner bed you see all over YINS. I force my eyes into focus, grasping for nouns that aren’t coming: the door-thing, the light-thing, these are all — this is —</p>
<p class="p1">Motherfucker. They dropped me off at YINS.</p>
<p class="p1">A tall man opens the door. His face fails to cohere, but it can only be Dr. Rui. He is holding something long, maybe tubular.</p>
<p class="p1">“Don’t get up,” he insists. “Give it a few minutes.”</p>
<p class="p1">I open my mouth in protest, but only soft shapes come out. Okay, a few minutes. A few minutes of silence, glancing triangularly from Rui to the door to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>my own legs. Bizarre to be under a blanket, in a Kanwei Glider. But cozy.</p>
<p class="p1">“Was I in loop-lock?”</p>
<p class="p1">Tethi, the club, the debris, the sunflowers, <i>Cai…</i>was that all…</p>
<p class="p1">Rui smiles and shakes his head. His features, big lips and furrowed brow, are coming into focus. “In this instance, the Glider is just the world’s most expensive cot. How are you feeling, Mona?”</p>
<p class="p1">I feel wrung out like a sponge. Like I’ve taken a floor to the face. I shrug. “Are you always here this late at night, Dr. Rui?”</p>
<p class="p1">“More often than I’d like.”</p>
<p class="p1">Among the hazards of my profession are intense, sporadic waves of derealization. Tonight, as many nights, I welcome these, wrap them around myself. The scanner bed, the scuffed-up primer-tile linoleum, even Dr. Rui — I can’t convince myself any of this is really here.</p>
<p class="p1">“Well,” I conclude, climbing out. “This is all a bit embarassing. I don’t suppose I could ask you not to tell Dr. Deng about all this?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Dr. Deng is on her way. She wasn’t happy to be woken at this time of night, but this is how she wanted to play it…” I don’t understand his meaning, but his tone suggests that Deng is the one in trouble.</p>
<p class="p1">“Play what?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Mona, before you leave, the Weather Bureau needs to take a statement from you. And, if you’ll hear it, there is a proposal.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Well, maybe they shouldn’t have dropped me here.”</p>
<p class="p1">The expression on Rui’s face is of a man with a frog in his mouth, debating whether to swallow. “Mona, I need you to know that it was never my idea to keep you in the dark. You’ve done plenty of good for the cause, and if we had been able to bring you on board, you could have done a lot more.”</p>
<p class="p1">The comfy waves of derealization are gone.</p>
<p class="p1"><i>Keep me in the dark? Whose idea?</i></p>
<p class="p1">And then it fucking hits me. The realization starts with the Observatory, the blank walls, the practiced reticence. Wouldn’t the Weather Bureau have a facility just like that? And it fans out to Cai: what exactly was she doing at Wu Ke Nai He? Carrying an inversion, decanted into one of Rui’s soberware containers, dumping it like a pesticide into a venue overflowing with neikotic debris. <i>My </i>inversion. Me, the unwitting silent partner in — what, exactly? <i>For how long?</i></p>
<p class="p1">“What are you doing with Tethi?” I lunge at Rui, catching a lapel. “If I’ve been such a big help to you, you need to let him go, you hear me?”</p>
<p class="p1">His face is as cast in different light, one that strikes hard bone instead of soft cheek and furrowed brow. There’s another Rui Zhang beneath the man I knew, and he looks pleased to finally meet me. I’m not sure the feeling is mutual.</p>
<p class="p1">“What’s funny,” this new Rui muses, “is that your friend Mbetethi Okeme is tonight’s bycatch. The Bureau has been looking for him almost since he showed up in the clinic, but the team tracking him was on the other side of the city.”</p>
<p class="p1">I don’t think that’s very funny, and I make that clear to Rui.</p>
<p class="p1">“Relax. The Weather Bureau has a short memory. It considers detainees a liability and grudges an operational hazard. If he reveals where and how he found the Sunflower Sieve egg in the Mirror Sea, he’ll walk free by sunrise.”</p>
<p class="p1">My own night in the Weather Bureau’s captivity, sure, let’s go there. The memory clouds, becoming ever more sinister, in nightmare after nightmare: hands on my back, hands putting me in cuffs, hands sedating me. Voices asking me the same question over and over in a blank white room. And now those are Dr. Rui’s spidery hands, his droll voice. He looks at me genially, and I stare blankly back — but know that there’s a Mona inside me who never quite left that room. Know that part of me wants to scream.</p>
<p class="p1">“This is good data,” he offers, unscrewing the tube in his hand. Inside is Tethi’s rollscroll. “You may resent me for saying this, but it’s extremely impressive that you figured this out on your own.”</p>
<p class="p1">Rui baits me with a few more comments about the quality of the recording, the fidelity with which our program reconstructs the computational hyperobject that briefly flared in the space between the minds at Wu Ke Nai He. I hold my silence. If they need to take a statement, let them take a statement. Eventually he looks down at me with a smile and a sigh.</p>
<p class="p1">“I know you’re upset, Mona, but if you’re up for a short walk, I’d like to show you something.”</p>
