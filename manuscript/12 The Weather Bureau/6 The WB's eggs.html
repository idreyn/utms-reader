<p class="p1"><i>Where are we?</i> The question consumes me as Rui leads me through a maze of unadorned walls and unlabeled doors. Finally he keys one open: I find myself standing among rows of shelves, these adorned with dozens of little labeled lumps of voxelite. A sterile, cold-storage fascimile of the Hall of Eggs.</p>
<p class="p1">“By no means is it a complete collection,” Rui concedes. “But this is every neikotic egg that the Weather Bureau has identified as originating in the Mirror Sea. I think it’s most instructive to consider them in chronological order.”</p>
<p class="p1">The eggs closest to us have a primeval, rough-hewn asymmetry to them. They tickle my neikotic channels as though with steel wool. But I know it when I see it. I could spend twenty minutes, an hour, pondering one of these, and…what?</p>
<p class="p1">“Mostly nothing of interest,” Rui puts in, reading my mind. “Crack them and you’ll find koans, toys, quines. Similar to the eggs you’d lay in a Neikotic Fundamentals class. Satisfying as <i>objets d’art</i>, but of real use to no one<i>. </i>The Weather Bureau was very lucky in this regard. The first person to find an egg in the Sea, some five years ago, thought she was losing it. She came clean immediately.”</p>
<p class="p1">I bristle. “And what happened to her?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Cai Yuhui became the Bureau’s trusted advisor and priceless asset.” Rui has that frog-swallowing face on again. “She positioned herself on the razor’s edge between neikotics and Ripplechasing, between madness and sanity, and she did what no one else could do. And we <i>will</i> find her, Mona, we will.”</p>
<p class="p1">Rui falls silent, his shaking hand gripping the cabinet too tightly. I can’t quite offer him a smile, but I offer him a nod.</p>
<p class="p1">“The eggs became more refined. They began to have real utility. Of course we can always choose to interpret this in the sensible way.”</p>
<p class="p1">“The Sea is just a thinking aid.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Right. Yes. The egg is only ever just a momentary swirl of noise in the Sea. All the work is in interpretation, the artful direction of attention. Let a neikonaut stare into the Mirror Sea, and they’ll spot patterns already in their mind, kissing the threshold of awareness.” He says this almost incantatively. “And for a while, the Weather Bureau did let them. The best way to draw attention to the Sea is to insist too hard on concealing it. The YINS Observatory opened, and a seaborn egg won the occasional neikonaut their doctorate. They were never loud about it. It was a blemish on their triumph that, if anything, the Weather Bureau encouraged them not to dwell on. The Big Three caught wind, and quietly began to buy up feeds, but they were more secretive still.”</p>
<p class="p1">Rui lingers on each of the eggs. As we traverse the shelf, they become more symmetrical, more elegant, more useful. Each is labeled with the name of a neikonaut, approximate location in the Sea, and an attempt to relay what the egg contains. Compared to the Hall of Eggs, these descriptions are rather vague and mysterious: <i>telltale wingbeats; repeated unfurlings; a way to see the same thing twice.</i> But two or three of them are algorithms that were considered state-of-the-art by all of neikotics. My heart almost stops when I see the one labeled <i>Tenfold Gate.</i> And what do they all have in common, these eggs? Why have these algorithms fallen from favor?</p>
<p class="p1">Neikotic debris.</p>
<p class="p1">If I ever lived through anything like the Sunflower Sieve before, it was when Tenfold Gate dropped. It was mostly useful in the world of finance, but even at YINS, it was a nightmare. The debris it left behind made its users twitch, dance, jump — once, from the crown of the Suowei Tower. I, the new volunteer clinican, had a front row seat. I was restraining patients, mopping up vomit, juggling intake forms — knowing the adults in the room, Rui and Qin and even Deng, had been working around the clock for weeks to calculate an inversion.</p>
<p class="p1">Rui sees me examining that particular egg. “They joked that Tenfold Gate was a debris generator that just happened to do pathfinding. I don’t know if you ever happened to use that lovely algorithm, but for the Weather Bureau, it was the first sign of where things were going. It produced the first debris that ever responded to the sight of the Ripples. It was, as far as we’re concerned, a protoype for the Sunflower Sieve.”</p>
