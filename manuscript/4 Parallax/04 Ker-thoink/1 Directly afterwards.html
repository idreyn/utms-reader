<p class="p1">“Let me see it,” I shout when I come down, flipping up the hood, ripping out the tube. “Let me —”</p>
<p class="p1">I make it two steps out of the scanner, but I can’t hold back the nausea. Tethi, bless him, is holding a bucket. And a while later, when I look a little better, he hands me a little bottle of water. “I’m sorry. Not to have warned you, primed you, whatever. But there’s nobody I can go to. You have no idea what a relief it is that you found it too.”</p>
<p class="p1">“No, <i>no, no, no...</i>you don’t understand,” I insist weakly. Retch again. “People see things in there all the time, but it’s just delusion, it’s...” What was the word the Weather Bureau used? “It’s maladaptive...”</p>
<p class="p1">“I thought that too, for a while. It’s how I justified selling it.” He smiles faintly, and I’m aware now of how foolish I sound explaining the Mirror Sea to a Chalker. Maybe a Chalker? <i>There are layers to it,</i> he’d said. “C’mere. I’ll show you what we can see from soberspace.”</p>
<p class="p1">He offers me the lone swivel chair over at the control bank. The inscrutable tiles of my loop-lock session play back on one screen; on another, dim aspect of the undisturbed Sea Sea. I can’t make out much of anything. In his printer bed, a copy of the Sunflower Sieve egg is under construction beneath several slashing injection heads. And on the floor is a massive beige box: when asked, I admit reluctantly that I don’t recognize it.</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s a correlation coprocessor.” He slaps it and regrets that immediately; the casing is still hot. “Every Mirror Sea display in the city is driven by one of these. Dug myself into a bit of a hole to buy it. Every Mirror Sea display in the city uses one to find interesting correlations. But a good neikonaut can blow a whole room of them out of the water. I’ll show you what it can piece together, but prepare to be underwhelmed.”</p>
<p class="p1">He has a flat view of the Sea up now on one of the monitors. He flexes his wrists, panning and zooming. “Look. This was the night I found it.” The dull grey Sea, roughly nothing, though the poor contrast of his monitor doesn’t help. Infrequently there are dim, spectral intrusions of sunlight, that’s all. “Uhh, <i>here.</i>” More nothing. Then a dim, silent, spherical flash of gold light.</p>
<p class="p1">I’m locked and loaded to insist that this doesn’t prove anything. But he begins to fost-forward with a theatrical flick. “<i>This</i> is what I saw and printed that night. Now, time passes, day, night, day, night…watch carefully, they test-fire it a few more times…”</p>
<p class="p1">“<i>Test-fire</i> it?”</p>
<p class="p1">The feed slows. Night falls on Shanghai, and night falls in the Sea, except for one insistent little pinprick, a tiny sun that won’t set. And then another, and another, three more now. It’s tentative, like a flame in wind, and then fierce, like a flame in wind. It looks like it comes from nowhere, only we know better. The Sea becomes a pulsing stellarium; the isolated nodes claw for one another until the viewport is laced with a fine scaffold of golden fissures. “That was the night it leaked online, when the Sieve came into general use. All of those nodes are really one point in the depths of the Sea, only the coprocessor can’t pick that up.”</p>
<p class="p1">He smiles grimly at me. I don’t smile back. I focus just past it, a flash of something reflective, and probing it as the diving-bell. The hollow, barely-recalled horror of wondering which side of some ragged mirror I was on. <i>You looked too hard, </i>hisses something awful inside me. It insists that I caused this, even though <i>I know</i> that doesn’t make any sense. It’s got Tethi too. It’s what he’s been trying to drink away…</p>
<p class="p1">“Mona?”</p>
<p class="p1">He catches me just before I hit the floor.</p>
