<p class="p1">“Let me see it,” I shout when I come down, flipping up the hood, ripping out the tube. “Let me —”</p>
<p class="p1">I make it two steps out of the scanner, but I can’t hold back the nausea. Tethi, bless him, is holding a bucket. And when I look a little better, he hands me a little bottle of water. “I’m sorry. Not to have warned you, primed you, whatever. But there’s nobody I can go to. You have no idea what a relief it is that you found it too.”</p>
<p class="p1">“No, <i>no, no, no...</i>you don’t understand,” I insist weakly. Retch again. “People see things in there all the time, but it’s just delusion, it’s...” What was the word the Weather Bureau used? “It’s maladaptive...”</p>
<p class="p1">“I thought that too, for a while. It’s how I justified selling it.” He smiles faintly, and I’m aware now of how foolish I sound explaining the Mirror Sea to a Chalker. Maybe a Chalker? <i>There are layers to it,</i> he’d said. “It’s in the printer,” he says now. “You said you wanted to see it.”</p>
<p class="p1">Another copy of the Sunflower Sieve egg thunks into the tray. Fresh, icy understanding spreads to my fingertips as I pick it up. And I pause. Saying it makes it real. “I meant…their city. That place. I’m…it’s crazy how much I can’t remember already. I need to see it in soberspace.”</p>
<p class="p1">“You can’t. Not really.” He taps a hefty grey box near the monitors. “This right here is a convolution coprocessor. Every Mirror Sea display in the city uses one to find interesting correlations. But a good neikonaut can blow a whole room of them out of the water. I’ll show you what it can piece together, but prepare to be underwhelmed.”</p>
<p class="p1">He has a flat view of the Sea up now on one of the monitors. He flicks his wrists, panning and zooming. “Look. This was the night I found it.” A dull grey Sea, roughly nothing, though the poor contrast of his monitor doesn’t help. Infrequently there are dim, spectral intrusions of sunlight, that’s all. “Uhh, <i>here.</i>” More nothing. Then a dim, silent, spherical flash of gold light.</p>
<p class="p1">I’m locked and loaded to insist that this doesn’t prove anything. But then he plucks one of the Sieve eggs off the table with a theatrical flick. “<i>This</i> is what I saw and printed that night. Now, time passes, day, night, day, night…watch carefully, they test-fire it a few more times…”</p>
<p class="p1">“<i>Test-fire</i> it?”</p>
<p class="p1">The feed slows. Night falls on Shanghai, and night falls in the Sea, except for one insistent little pinprick, a tiny sun that won’t set. And then another, and another, three more now. It’s tentative, like a flame in wind, and then fierce, like a flame in wind, until the Sea is laced with a whole network of golden fissures. “That was the night that <i>this</i> leaked online.” He picks up the second egg now, offers both for my examination. They’re different, subtly so, in the details of the flecks and the tubules.</p>
<p class="p1">“Someone else is seeing this,” I mutter. I take it back;<i> this</i> is what makes it real. “I thought, that night at Double Descent, that you dropped it.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Then you don’t yet know me very well.” He wags a finger, smiling, trying to be funny. “Don’t let go of what you already have. That’s just about my number one rule.”</p>
<p class="p1">I don’t smile back. I focus just past it, a flash of something reflective, and probing it as the diving-bell. The hollow, barely-recalled horror of wondering which side of some ragged mirror I was on. <i>You looked too hard, </i>hisses something awful inside me. It insists that I caused this, even though <i>I know</i> that doesn’t make any sense. It’s got Tethi too. It’s what he’s been trying to drink away…</p>
<p class="p1">“Mona?”</p>
<p class="p1">He catches me just before I hit the floor.</p>
