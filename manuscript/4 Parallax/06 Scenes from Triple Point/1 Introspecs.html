<p class="p1">The thing is, it worked better than I dared expect.</p>
<p class="p1">I place a hand awkwardly on Tethi’s shoulder. From my backpack I offer him a squashed pack of tissues. But he casts off the grief and the readonly net in one fluid motion. I decide it must have been intentional.</p>
<p class="p1">“This is <i>insane</i>,” he mutters, watching the recording from our readouts. Sunflower Sieve debris clatters back and forth between our minds. The shapes are vague but unmistakable, neutrally buoyant, bobbing in an emotional carrier wave. I feel the debris still in my mind reaching out towards the screen. I remember to look obliquely.</p>
<p class="p1">“This might be enough to bring to Deng. It contradicts her old results. She should see this.” She should look me in the eye, Rui too, and explain what that sunflower patch is.</p>
<p class="p1">“No. It’s not. Besides, I want to see it at larger scale.” Tethi has motives of his own, something to prove. He’s already got schematics and wiring diagrams, it turns out. Elaborations on a late-night throwaway idea. He lets me peruse a long list of materials. “Can you get all of this from YINS?”</p>
<p class="p1">“I thought you said this would be impossible?”</p>
<p class="p1">“I thought again.” His hand sweeps his desk. Finds, already half-buried, something a little like sunglasses. “Do you know what these are?”</p>
