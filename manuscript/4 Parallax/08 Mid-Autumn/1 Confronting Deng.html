<p class="p1">“And this is a friend of yours?”</p>
<p class="p1">It all happened so fast. Maybe it’s the residuals of the Triple Point night market, blurring these few days into an ever-lingering present. I didn’t tell Tethi that I went inside. I know I was very lucky to have walked out. And now here we are, in the indifferent blast of YINS air conditioning, across from Deng and Rui. Neither Tethi or I have slept. I was running the numbers; he was watching for official word on what happened during the Mid-Autumn festival.</p>
<p class="p1">Tethi is not dressed for the job he wants. The YINS researchers walking past us are in athleisure and graphic tees, struggling to manage even half a hairdo. He is in bootleg Docs, subtly iridescent dress slacks, a spotless white shirt and collarless jacket that bought en route. The coils of his hair are tamed back, still damp. The rhombus gemstone from his forehead is gone; I wonder what to make of this. “Tethi Okeme,” he tells Deng and Rui, sounding spritely. Maybe manic, with the lack of sleep. They take his offered hand, a little bewilderment leaking through.</p>
<p class="p1">“And you are a researcher?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Yes,” Tethi tells them.</p>
<p class="p1">“A colleague,” I offer, uselessly, at the same time. There’s so much we haven’t gone over. <i>Do they know who he is?</i> Did they look at the Sieve case files? I scheduled this meeting at four in the morning, once our data took shape. Rui and Deng had the same hour open, which was crucial: I wanted to see them react simultaneously. <i>What is this??</i> Deng asked via email a little past five. She hadn’t heard from me in more than a week. But they both showed. We’re all here. It’s time.</p>
<p class="p1">“Esteemed professors,” Tethi begins, layering on the honorifics, starting the slideshow. “Thank you for the opportunity to share our work. I hope our results will shed timely light on something which has attracted the city’s urgent interest since last night.”</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s what he doesn’t tell them. He skips the moment I arrived at Triple Point for the last time and burst out laughing at the sight of him. It was utterly endearing, the way he had it all ready to go: the pushcart, the sorted piles of rave paraphernalia, a forged vendor’s permit to boot. He doesn’t mention Min, but she was there too. She came out to see us off, faintly skeptical of the whole thing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“So <i>this</i> is how you’re going to spend the festival! Why not just enjoy things, Teth? Why be like this?”</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s fish in a barrel, <i>Min ayi</i>. We need the money.”</p>
<p class="p1">“No, good! Go, go on, take it out. None of it sells in the shop.” She turned to me with a sly smile. “This is how I found him, you know. Selling this absolute junk on the streets.”</p>
<p class="p1">Something passed between them then, broadband and narrowbeam, that I wasn’t privy to. I had questions about the story they couldn’t quite keep straight. And surely <i>she</i> had questions about Tethi’s backpack, big enough to live out of for some indefinite future. But they kept up the charade ’til he was outside. Then he turned on his heel, just as the door chimed open, and they embraced in the warm light of the shopfront. I watched from under the concrete as she wiped away his tears, held back her own. <i>I will, I will, </i>I thought I heard him say.</p>
<p class="p1">He doesn’t mention any of this. He discusses empathetic baselines, neikotic transference, soberware. We decided it was best to start in Deng and Rui’s world before ramping slowly to the Ripples, their hidden city, their technology. But what he’s already told them is shock enough.</p>
<p class="p1">“You <i>what?</i>” Deng ignores Tethi. Addresses me. Her face begins to ice over.</p>
<p class="p1">“You showed me that video. You said it that this transference could never work.” Trying to keep my voice level. Keep the focus on our data. I don’t want a blowout. “But it does. We’re telling you now that it does.”</p>
<p class="p1">“We’ll see about that,” she mutters. Rui offers her a subtle gesture: <i>careful, calm.</i></p>
<p class="p1">I nod Tethi on. I suppose he’s seen worse. Now he produces some sleek eyewear from his jacket pocket, slides it across the table. “Do you both know what these are?”</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I’m sure they do. Introspecs were </span><span class="s2">red-hot a few years ago and popular ever since. What might be sunglasses, every edge a curve, a hi-res screen conjoining the outer lenses. The stems have very simple UTMS sensors, used to divine the wearer’s emotion and splash it in color across their eyes. We spent a hellish, weird, wonderful week cracking them open and rewiring them into Sunflower Sieve debris detectors. </span><span class="s1">Tethi skips most of that. And he has no interest in recounting what it’s like to sell Introspecs from a pushcart in Tianzifang. But that’s what will stick with me.</span></p>
<p class="p1">“You gotta put the emphasis on the first syllable. Listen. <i>In</i>-tro-speeeecs!” He cupped his hands, and his voice carried halfway down the low brick alleyway, swallowed quickly in music and footfall and the cries of other hawkers.</p>
<p class="p1">“No. C’mon. You sound like you’re selling hot dogs at a baseball game. In Mandarin, you gotta get a patter going. Take everything we have and string it all together, a little too fast.” Then, bringing my voice up into my nose: “Genzhe globes — Introspecs — Flower crowns — Quasi wands — Genzhe globes...” I rifled through the pushcart, layers of cheap plastic treasures and horrors pilfered from Min’s storeroom. “Christ, what else do we have in here?”</p>
<p class="p1">He gave me the stink eye. “Hey, who’s done this before?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Now Deng gives me the same look, turning the glasses distastefully. “You were <i>selling</i> these?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Well, we weren’t going to give them away.” Tethi laughs nervously. I wish we’d thought this through.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">It was the Mid-Autumn Festival, and hell: it was <i>fun</i>, munching mooncakes and slurping cuchaomian and watching children drag their parents on endless, circular hunts for quasigraphic rabbits. In the lantern-light, in the wash of six different kinds of music, it was easy to forget why we came. Except that the Mirror Sea was there, ever-present on walls and doors and the genzhe globes bouncing just above head-height, so turbulent with Ripples that the golden streaks were impossible to make out. Almost.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">We posted up near a bar playing the kind of glitch-riddled music that neikonauts love, with a name so pretentious it doesn’t bear repeating. Still, we sold a dozen unmodified pairs of Introspecs before we reeled in our first neikonaut.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“A pair each for me and my girl.” He was short with us, distracted, obviously on something. They were listing colors to each other, running out of obvious ones, delighting in this.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“Two hundred for the both,” Tethi decided, as the neikonaut’s hard wallet opened with a <i>ker-click</i> worth more than my life. I deliberated, handed over one pair marked with an orange sticker and one without. We grimaced as the marked pair went to the non-neikonaut.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“<i>Merde</i>. Okay. Pair number sixteen is a bust.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">But then a Chaoyue happy hour cleared out, and we managed to get thirty-one pairs on the heads of neikonauts. Some of them just went home, but Tianzifang’s dense layout worked to our advantage. It trapped revelers for hours in a maze of boutiques and erhu trios and duck-hunt street games. The Introspecs formed a wireless mesh network, geared up so we could tell roughly how far each pair was from the others. As it took shape, we began to peek at Tethi’s rollscroll, looking for correlations…</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“You know this is a <i>massive</i> violation of the YINS research ethics code?” Deng leans across the table, her gaze boring into mine. Her voice is soft, steady, cold. “Do you know that I’m compelled by the bylaws of this institution to report you for running an experiment like this without the subjects’ consent?”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“<i>Please</i>. Let them finish.” Rui shoots me a laden glance. “Let’s see what they have to say.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Tethi advances the slide. The tension is getting to him. “What we have to say is that it worked.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">It didn’t, for a while. From a corner we watched acrobats and puppeteers dazzle a crowd that was still families, still waiting around for the dragon dancers. When they came, we were reassured to catch the beat of their hand-drums on our neikotic readouts. The Introspecs have very low resolution, and until then had given us mostly noise.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">After a respectful intermission came the parade of Ripple dances. An obvious conceit, but it made my hair stand up, watching the people beneath those sheets undulate with elsewhere’s choreography. It made me feel strange: how most of the Ripples represented were long-dead, brought out for a momentary afterlife by those who couldn’t let it go. I knew it was coming, <i>and there it was,</i> all purple-orange-yellow coral wriggles. I held my breath; Tethi squeezed my hand. Later we watched a Ripple with gold-and-black sparkling accents march by. I wondered if Yao was under there.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The data Tethi is presenting now is mostly from the hour after that. The crowd thinned and thickened, took on a looser and darker tone. The erhu players packed up. And slowly, the Sunflower Sieve’s presence came to the foreground. Tethi doesn’t condescend to Rui and Deng: the story is told in correlation matrices and impulse responses, but the implications are unmistakable. The kicker is the next slide. A short composite of all our sensor data. I spent <i>hours</i> on it, and I’m pleased to watch Rui outright gasp as it unfolds...</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">We were crouched in the corner by then, our legs failing us. We had sold the rest of our wares to another hawker for a song. It was triumph and it was deep unease, watching the rollscroll. The fourteen neikonauts left in the crowd spanned a coarse map of the alleyways, and we saw debris-shapes floating predictably between them. The Introspecs might be cheap, but they worked like a telescope array tuned to a powerful frequency. And our shifting view — of gardens of hyperlagmites, of high spires of debris, of slow shapes moving among these that we didn’t dare name — it was low resolution, monochrome, but chillingly clear. I resisted a familiar tug. I knew that I’d be able to look, look too hard, and make out precisely this on the displays.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“Look,” I told Tethi. “Look at number sixteen.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“What about it?” He leaned in, mouth full of mooncake. “<i>Wait. </i>She wasn’t a neikonaut.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">We had written her off, but her readout was still there, and now...</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“Am I just seeing things here? I can’t tell.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“It’s borderline,” he agreed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">It’s still borderline. I give it another hard look as it pops up in the slides. Tethi decides not to mention it for now. “Before I go on, a primer on Mirror Sea pop mythology may be in order. Are you familiar with the term <i>hyperlagmites?</i>”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“Yes.” Rui cracks his knuckles. Absentmindedly does that thing with his pen. He looks utterly transfixed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“Just get on with it,” Deng snaps.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">There’s no consensus on what exactly happened last night. For one thing, it happened in dozens of places all at different times. In Tianzifang, it came first as a low gasp working through the crowd. “The moon,” I whispered. A richly colored harvest moon crested the tiles of Tianzifang’s low-slung rooftops. “Teth, the <i>moon</i>.” It hung close, enormous, worth the wait by far…</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“Would you look at that <i>gold</i>.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“It’s huge! It’s so round!”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">But not everyone was pointing at the moon. Half the crowd was pointing at the Mirror Sea.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">We all at least agree what what followed was very fast. Even for those with eyes on the Sea, it would have been a shock. One moment, a bewitchingly golden orb emerges, glowing bright against those swirling nighttime textures. It stays perfectly still in precisely the way things in the Sea don’t. And like <i>that</i>, it collapses. Convulses, rapid-fire, twenty wild shapes in two seconds. The aftershock of information seen but not understood, flame-wrought patterns ringing in your mind, painful streaks behind closed eyes. It was, by all accounts, unsettling.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">But to see the <i>moon</i> do that…</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">There was a panic. Deep-seated confusion about just where one had been looking a few moments ago, about who had seen what, and if you were unlucky, about whether the moon had just imploded. But there was no aftermath. No wreckage to gawk at. The moon was where the moon goes, and the thing in the Sea receded as suddenly as it came. You could tell which fraction of the Mirror Sea displays were sanctioned: those went offline, blinking the Weather Bureau’s insignia. A stunned silence gave way to low, uneasy chatter. Slow but certain movement home. The night came to an abrupt, though orderly, end.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Tethi stands awkwardly with the clicker, the words THANK YOU projected across his face.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">And Rui’s brow furrows. “Could you go back to that last slide?”</span></p>
