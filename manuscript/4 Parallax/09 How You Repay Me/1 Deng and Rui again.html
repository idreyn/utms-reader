<p class="p1">Tethi is not dressed for the job he wants. The YINS researchers walking past us are in athleisure and graphic tees, struggling to manage even half a hairdo. He’s in bootleg Docs, dress slacks, a creamsicle-paisley buttondown. The coils of his hair are tamed back, still damp. It’s been about six hours since we climbed out of the sewers. Three since I emailed Dr. Deng and, almost as an afterthought, cc’ed Dr. Rui — who bobs into the conference room a few minutes early, enthusiastically shakes Tethi’s hand (“<i>Mm-bey-teh-thi</i>, do I have that right?”) and offers me a reassuring nod. Deng arrives two minutes late — that’s one hundred twenty seconds, by her usual reckoning — and looks me over with multiplex fury and curiosity and relief as she pulls out a chair. <i>Where have you been? Why haven’t you responded to any of my emails?</i> And if I look for it, <i>I’m so glad you’re safe.</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“And this is a friend of yours?”</p>
<p class="p1">“A colleague,” Tethi corrects, with a collegial smile.</p>
<p class="p1">“A researcher,” I add uselessly. I have trouble looking her in the eyes. When I do, my gut drops out with the memory of what it felt like to go unseen and disappear.</p>
