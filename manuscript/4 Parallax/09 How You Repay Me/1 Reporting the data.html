<p class="p1">Of course I should have expected Yao. Tethi and I get lots of badly-concealed glances when we step onto the Safety floor the next morning, but Yao’s the one to come greet me. Which makes me feel terrible.</p>
<p class="p1">“You look terrible, Mona,” he tells me bluntly. “Everyone’s wondering where you’ve been.” And if he hates me, how could I blame him? I called in a four-oh-eight on him, got him sent to Medical, and then disappeared for an entire week to chase the very same strand of madness. I think he sees that, somehow. Sees it as a vindication, somehow. His head swivels past me now. “Wait, is that —?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Hello.” Tethi waves sheepishly from the water fountain. “I remember you.”</p>
<p class="p1">“He’s visiting for the day,” I tell Yao quickly, as if that explains anything. “Listen, I’m sorry for what happened last week, and that I’ve been away, and...<i>there is something,</i>” I go on, voice lowered, “<i>about the Sieve. That’s why he’s here —</i>”</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s all right,” Yao brushes me off. “You did the right thing. I went quadratic, and you made the right call. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d rather not hear whatever it is you want to say.” And he strides away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Tethi and I exchange an uneasy look. Good lord, the Bureau did a number on him.</p>
<p class="p1">We find Deng and Rui in the corner conference room, as arranged. For Deng and I, this is familiar ground: it’s hardly the first time I’ve dropped off for a week, refusing to answer or even look at my emails. But usually I don’t return with a friend, or with the lure of groundbreaking experimental data. She greets me with commingled <i>where the hell have you been</i> and <i>I’m so glad you’re all right.</i> Rui lopes over, enthusiastically shakes Tethi’s hand (“<i>Mm-bey-teh-thi</i>, do I have that right?”) and offers me a reassuring nod.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Tethi is not dressed for the job he wants. The YINS researchers walking by are in athleisure and graphic tees, struggling to manage even half a hairdo. He’s in bootleg Docs, dress slacks, a creamsicle-paisley buttondown. Deng looks him over and then addresses me. “So this is a friend of yours?”</p>
<p class="p1">“A colleague,” Tethi corrects, with a collegial smile.</p>
<p class="p1">“A researcher,” I add uselessly. Briefly I look her in the eyes, and my gut drops out with the memory of what it felt like to go unseen and disappear. “You might also remember him as our first Sunflower Sieve patient. He and I have something we think the two of you will want to see.” And what I don’t say is<i>: Do you know? Do you know that there’s something out there wearing your face?</i> In the six hours since we climbed out of the sewer, I’ve felt nonstop stings of panic every time I see a Mirror Sea camera over my shoulder. The horrible feeling of that <i>thing</i> watching me from just behind some gauzy veil, ready and willing at any moment to rip me back into that endless field of sunflowers. And then, even worse, that when I’m out of its view I may simply slip away.</p>
<p class="p1">Rui leans forward with interest, just as Deng leans back in her chair. Sometimes I wonder if she’s learned to flash her glasses that way on purpose. “Well, we’re here. Have at it.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Esteemed professors,” Tethi begins, and means it. He takes a deep breath — there’s still so much we haven’t gone over. “Thank you for the opportunity to present our work. It pertains to the events that have troubled the neikotics community since they came to light this morning.”</p>
<p class="p1">A beat. “We were there,” I add.</p>
<p class="p1">Deng’s face goes white. “You were <i>there?</i>”</p>
<p class="p1">Of course the word is out. Hundreds of neikonauts at Wu Ke Nai He fell into that same trance — and, sure, that’s not exactly front-page news. What’s unusual is the <i>way</i> they fell into the sunflowers — not transfixed by a Ripple, but forced into it by what they describe as primer tiles, flashed by a dazzling reflective structure in the Sea. Stranger still are rumors that the Weather Bureau took scores of non-neikonauts into medical veetles, where some remember sitting inside a UTMS scanner, for unclear reasons, for the first time in their lives. There has been no official word from the Bureau or Blue Delta, and so there has been no official response from YINS. But it’s on tip of our tongues, lodged in our throats: we are in danger. As a precaution, the Mirror Sea displays across Beiwan Ward have gone black.</p>
<p class="p1">This same morning, across the city in Hongqiao South, a middle school science teacher rose with an early alarm. He dragged his telescope up to the rooftop, and snapped a beautiful photo of the moon, harvest gold, rich contrast along the rabbit. Then he swiveled the lens down past the horizon towards the side of a Super Eight motel — perhaps something caught his eye, or perhaps this is his habit — and produced a second, strikingly similar image. <i>The Moon in the Sea,</i> his plaintive caption reads. By mid-morning his paired images had thousands of shares, thousands of comments: <i>The Vast-Cold Palace Alights Upon Our Banks</i> or simply <i>Anyone Know What The Fuck This Is?</i></p>
<p class="p1">Well, Tethi and I know what it is. He starts at the beginning, no secrets, no deception. Where he lives, why he lives there, what he saw when he tiled into stolen feeds from Wu Ke Nai He. Okay, we gloss over some parts. My professors listen — Deng’s lips tight, Rui’s fingers tented — until Tethi gets to the part where, on the damp of his floor, we ran Deng and Rui’s failed experiment for the second time in two decades. We found evidence of Sunflower Sieve debris reaching through words, through eye contact, reacting across minds. We —</p>
<p class="p1">“I showed you that video <i>in confidence!</i>” Deng finally interjects.</p>
<p class="p1">“It was an experiment.” I keep my voice low and level. Focus on the data. I don’t want a blowout. “You said that the two of you couldn’t get it to work. Well, we’re telling you now that it does.”</p>
<p class="p1">“We’ll see about that.” She folds her arms. Rui offers a gesture, to her, to us: <i>careful, calm</i>.</p>
<p class="p1">Tethi looks to me for support, and hell, I told him it might go this way. But it can’t be easy, being chewed out by one of your scientific heroes. It barely gets easier with time. Slowly, he lays out the parameters of a larger experiment. He does not condescend to Deng and Rui: he tells the story with impulse responses and correlation matrices. He slides a pair of Introspecs across the table —</p>
<p class="p1">And Deng’s eyes flash. “You were <i>selling </i>these?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Well,” Tethi tries helplessly to lighten the mood. “We were hardly going to give them away.”</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“You know this is a <i>massive</i> violation of the YINS research ethics code?” Deng ignores him entirely. She leans across the table, her gaze boring into mine. Her voice is soft, steady, cold. “Do you know that I’m compelled by the bylaws of this institution to report you for running an experiment like this without the subjects’ consent?”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“<i>Please</i>. Let them finish.” Rui shoots me a laden glance. “Let’s see what they have to say.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“In some ways,” Tethi continues, now with a nervous edge, “I think you already know the rest of the story. There was a massive correlation event at Wu Ke Nai He. We have neikotic evidence that, whatever was in the Mirror Sea, there was a...corresponding structure...operating across minds last night. What we have here is a composite of the sensor data, from almost a hundred headsets. From neikonauts, and...not.” He clears his throat. “I wonder if a brief primer on the popular mythology of the Mirror Sea is in order. Have you both heard the term <i>hyperlagmites?</i>”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Yes,” Rui replies. He’s leaning in to get a better look at the Ripples’ handiwork, at the world’s first real application of soberware. Half-awed, half-devastated, and totally transfixed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I spent hours on this next slide, and I’m a little pleased that Rui gasps when he sees it. The UTMS electrodes on the Introspecs were cheap, but in combination they worked like a telescope array tuned to a powerful frequency, clearly resolving that skeletal network of Sieve debris. As our unwitting subjects moved deeper into the crowd, it revealed hyperlagmites, high spires of debris, slow shapes moving among these that we didn’t dare name. Our images of the Ripples’ city come as a short, looping video. It’s low-res, monochrome, but chillingly clear. There in the dead center, a white-hot spherical blot, is the Sunflower Sieve. The thing that put all those neikonauts into loop-lock at once.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“If it can be said to be anything specific, anything earthly at all...” And my voice is positively shaking now. “We think the Ripples have built a Deng Bridge.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For a long while no one speaks. Tethi flips to the next slide — which just reads <i>THANK YOU</i> — and neither of us know quite where to look. Perhaps a PowerPoint was not the way to deliver this news.</span></p>
