<p class="p1">Tethi is not dressed for the job he wants. The YINS researchers walking past us are in athleisure and graphic tees, struggling to manage even half a hairdo. He’s in bootleg Docs, dress slacks, a creamsicle-paisley buttondown. The coils of his hair are tamed back, still damp. I notice that the rhombus from his forehead is gone, has been gone, and I wonder what to make of this. “Tethi Okeme,” he tells Deng and Rui, sounding spritely. Maybe manic, with the lack of sleep. Deng shakes his offered hand, but offers me a bewildered glance. I’ve been ignoring her emails for a week. A shiver passed through me when she stepped into this dull little conference room. I remembered in my gut what it felt like to go unseen and disappear.</p>
<p class="p1">“And this is a friend of yours?”</p>
<p class="p1">“A colleague,” Tethi corrects, with a collegial smile.</p>
<p class="p1">“A researcher,” I add uselessly.</p>
<p class="p1">“And you have something to show us. Well, we’re here.” Deng’s face does something lopsided as she tries to return his smile while also glancing at me with, what, relief? Disapproval? <i>What is this? Where on earth have you been?</i></p>
<p class="p1">Dr. Rui pushes his chair forward to give Tethi an appraising look. I give him more of a grimace. <i>There’s so much we haven’t gone over. </i>It’s been barely twenty-four hours since we climbed out of that tunnel. “Esteemed professors,” Tethi begins, and offers them both an earnest nod. “Thank you for the opportunity to allow us to present our work. We hope to shed light a matter of some urgency, that has captured a portion of the city’s interest of late. It relates to the Mirror Sea.”</p>
<p class="p1">Their faces remain loop-lock still, save for a tiny, symmetrical glance. And, brandishing the clicker, Tethi begins his bid for a position at YINS. He starts Deng and Rui’s world, discussing empathetic baselines, neikotic transference, soberware. Better to ramp up from there before getting to the Ripples, their hidden city, their technological prowess. But what he’s already told them is shock enough.</p>
<p class="p1">“You <i>what?</i>” Deng ignores Tethi. Addresses me. Her face begins to ice over.</p>
<p class="p1">“You showed me that video. That experiment you two ran all those years ago. You said that this transference could never work.” Trying keep my voice level and focus on our data. I don’t want a blowout. “But it does. We’re telling you now that it does.”</p>
<p class="p1">“We’ll see about that,” she mutters. Rui offers her a subtle gesture: <i>careful, calm.</i></p>
<p class="p1">Deftly, flipping through slides, Tethi lays out the parameters of a our experiment. Now he produces a pair of Introspecs from his jacket pocket, and slides them across the table for examination. “Do you both know what these are?”</p>
<p class="p1">“You were <i>selling</i> these?” Again she addresses me, with utter distaste.</p>
<p class="p1">“Well, we were hardly going to give them away.” Tethi grins, but no one is laughing.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“You know this is a <i>massive</i> violation of the YINS research ethics code?” Deng leans across the table, her gaze boring into mine in a terribly familiar way. Her voice is soft, steady, cold. “Do you know that I’m compelled by the bylaws of this institution to report you for running an experiment like this without the subjects’ consent?”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>I can hardly bear to look at her. I want to say: <i>Do you know that the sunflowers have a message for you? Do you know that something out there is wearing your face?</i></p>
<p class="p1">“<i>Please</i>, Dr. Deng.” Rui insists. “Let’s just see what they have to say.”</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Tethi doesn’t condescend: he tells the story with data, correlation matrices and impulse responses, but the implications are unmistakable. In an environment like Wu Ke Nai He, Sunflower Sieve debris appears to move like a liquid from mind to mind, even washing up in non-neikonauts. The kicker is the next slide. A short composite of all our sensor data. Rui gasps when he sees it. The UTMS electrodes on the Introspecs were cheap, but in combination they worked like a telescope array tuned to a powerful frequency, clearly resolving that skeletal network of Sieve debris. As our unwitting subjects moved deeper into the crowd, it revealed hyperlagmites, high spires of debris, slow shapes moving among these that we didn’t dare name. Our images are low-res, monochrome, but chillingly clear.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Tethi talks about the well-known, poorly understood resonance between the Mirror Sea and Shanghai’s psychology. About where the Ripples must actually live, as much in our minds as on those screens. With a few differential equations he sketches an interaction between a Ripple and an idealized piece of neikotic debris. Rui is leaning in to get a better look at the Ripples’ handiwork, at the world’s first real application of soberware. Half-awed, half-devastated, and totally transfixed. And then there’s nothing else to say. Tethi stands awkwardly with the clicker, the words THANK YOU projected across his face. For a long moment, Deng and Rui are totally silent.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In retrospect, perhaps, a PowerPoint was not the way to deliver this news.</span></p>
