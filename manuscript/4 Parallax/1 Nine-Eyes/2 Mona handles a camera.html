<p class="p1">The door chimes Infrasong as I step inside, sending my spine tingling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s dim halogen, floor to ceiling pegboard shelving, and maybe <i>miscellaneous</i> is an understatement. Blenders and water heaters are stocked between factory-reject TPU arrays and stadium-grade quasigram projectors. A row of plastic tubs brims with voxelite pilfered from the city’s trading floors, three eggs for twenty ping. But a familiar iridescence draws my eye, and then my feet, to the glass display case in the back.</p>
<p class="p2">The shopkeeper reserved all their care for these smoothly metallic teardrops, two dozen total, each in its own foam-lined case. I never noticed from ground level how much they vary in shape. But they’re all the size of a hand fruit, with the same basic structure. The tapered side has an inlet for CAT-5. The bulbous end hides the lens behind mirrored coating. It’s stamped with the blind-eye that has become synonymous with Shanghai.</p>
<p class="p1">“Get a load of the serial numbers.” A quiet voice startles me, emerging from the back through thick plastic drapes. The laoban is a woman just past the crest of middle age, with a sharp chin, weathered features, a pleasant crinkle around the eye. Her hair is buzzed perfunctorily short. “Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-five-seven-nine,” she reads fondly off the leftmost Mirror Sea camera. She speaks so softly that I have to lean in to make this out. “This is a prototype from the the Century Park pilot. But, count the digits — they had ambitions.”</p>
<p class="p1">This woman is Zhang Peifeng, I realize. Or rather she has his N-1 license, and used it to log into the Soup and contact Deng. The cameras, the weird and stilted messages to an old colleague, it all adds up to something like this. I consider how to come clean. And then — despite my purpose here, despite everything, I ask: “Can I hold it?”</p>
<p class="p1">I expect her to laugh me off, but she nods solemnly and fetches a pair of microfiber gloves for each of us. “They had a real problem with fingerprints at first. The hash is sensitive to patterns like that — careful, <i>careful</i>,” she mutters, placing it into my hands. It has real heft, maybe double what I expected. “Here, take the front and give it a twist.”</p>
<p class="p1">I do, gingerly, feeling three tiny clicks and a satisfying counterclockwise whir. Then, from a seam unseen, the hemispherical cap falls into my hand. There’s a milky-quartz dragonfly eye behind it, or that’s how it looks, hundreds of nearly opaque facets that let light play through them only along intricate, rainbow-flecked micrometer grooves. An optical implementation of the Lam-Waldmann hash, carved by laser into real quartz. For the architects of the Mirror Sea, there could be no second-guessing the anonymizing properties of their surveillance system. A conventional lens, with the hash running in software behind it, would never win the public’s trust.</p>
<p class="p1">She hesitates now, leaning around me to peer out at the deserted, unlit courtyard. From a locked box beneath the cabinet, she produces a truly ancient CRT monitor no wider than my hand. She looks me over, once, twice, and then asks, “would you like to see?”</p>
<p class="p1">What the Weather Bureau did left me with a reflexive <i>no</i> to this question. But I didn’t come here to look away. I nod, and she peeks up, out the window, back at me. Satisfied, she digs for a power cable. It occurs to me that since entering Fengzhen Ward I haven’t seen a single Mirror Sea display. Not on the walls, not embedded in the sidewalks, not even on a cheap TV by a sushi-counter fish tank. Something half-dawns on me. <i>But if she thinks it’</i>s <i>safe</i>...</p>
<p class="p1">She clips a CAT-5 cable into the camera and it beeps once. “Now look.”</p>
<p class="p1">I gasp softly when I see what appears onscreen. It has depth, this jagged and concentric formation. It reflects faint hints of Min’s Miscellaneous in the color, texture, and geometry of its facets. I would say it’s kaleidoscopic, but there’s a way in which it’s precisely not: while a kaleidoscope is sensitive to tiny movements, the Lam-Waldmann Hash of the store’s interior barely changes as I swing the camera around. I point the lens at the shopkeeper; she raises an eyebrow, but appears only as a dark bloom on the peaks of larger waves. After a while she gestures for the camera back.</p>
<p class="p1">“I’ll part with it for forty thousand ping.” She smiles at my nervous laughter. “But not lightly, and not for a stranger. It serves me better as a conversation piece, anyway. So what can I really do for you?”</p>
<p class="p1">“I’m looking for Dr. Zhang Peifeng.” I steady myself. I make it a statement and not a question, and scan her politely bemused eyes for recognition. “I — he — we talked on the —”</p>
<p class="p1">The door crashes open. She saw it happening, but too late, one hand stowing the monitor and the other reaching fruitlessly for a remote to lock the door. Two tall, black-clad figures stride down the center aisle in perfect unison, and I have the horrible sense that something alien watches us through the fixed parallax of their four beady eyes. <i>But that’s the wrong number of eyes.</i> A three-by-three diamond formation of stylized eyes is painted — no, tattooed — onto their chalk-white foreheads. They blink in the strangest sort of way: I can pry them open one by one with my attention, but they snap closed the moment I look away. I know who these people are; I just never believed they existed.</p>
<p class="p1">The Chalkers aren’t a monolith. Their disagreements play out on the walls, just under our noses. Their affiliations are — not to put too fine a point on it — as ephemeral and illegible as anything you’d find in the Mirror Sea. But there are old ways to be remembered. Beliefs, root-level and bone-dry, to be held in a deeply parabolic stillness and silence. And the Nine-Eyes keep them, in their triple-point redoubts, studded with Mirror Sea cameras but utterly devoid of Mirror Sea displays. <i>Because —</i> the thought prickles my from neck into my shoulders — <i>because they don’t need them, any more than a fish needs a snorkel. </i>No, that’s not quite right. <i>Any more than the ocean needs a snorkel.</i></p>
<p class="p1">“You looked,” one of them intones. The way his voice cracks, almost squeaks, from extended disuse: it would be funny, but it isn’t. They both speak at the same time.<i> “We just saw you looking.”</i> The words come with — no, the words <i>are</i> a tightening grasp, choking me into a tight loop of only-just-memory, of gazing into the output of that single camera. I grip the glass countertop, ripping my gaze back towards the woman, who I’ve decided must be Min. There’s fear on her face, but mixed with a gradation of annoyance and a glimmer of thrilled amusement. Most likely this has happened before.</p>
<p class="p1">“Our arrangement has been in place for a long time.” She emphasizes those last two words, as though speaking for the record, for an unseen observer. “I can’t sell just to you. The shop won’t survive. It was <i>one</i> camera —”</p>
<p class="p1"><i>“Too close. Too often.” </i>They redouble their insistence, the words growing convex. <i>“Not careful. And at night.”</i></p>
<p class="p1">With a telescoping baton, with metronomic four-four precision, one of them begins to break things. The other leans down towards Min, his forehead in her face, her eyes locked into something I can’t see. Whatever fury irradiates her, it exists at such a scale that these men amount to mere pinholes. Maybe that’s what she finds amusing. But she sighs, infuriated, as the Nine-Eye palms her antique camera. “We’re taking this. No sale.”</p>
<p class="p1">“The fuck you are,” comes a voice from the back. A voice — my head spins, drowning in the perfectly periodic crashing sounds coming from the aisles — a voice that I <i>recognize</i>. The plastic curtain parts again, and there stands Mbetethi Okeme. Tethi. Whatever. “Put it down and go.”</p>
<p class="p1">Two things: Tethi is taller than this Chalker, which counts for something, and his gaze is positively blazing with Sunflower Sieve debris. I wouldn’t call it a controlled burn, but he’s got a mental harness or two around it — I see him smile when it whips in a direction I can only describe as outwards. He clears the counter fluidly and stings the closer Nine-Eyes with a small and possibly homemade taser. The sound it makes, the <i>smell</i> it makes: it should have sent the man writhing to the floor. But he only peers back at Tethi with timid, almost pathetic surprise.</p>
<p class="p1"><i>“Go,”</i> Tethi shouts again. “You need us here. This the arrangement.” To my astonishment, they do. The stung Chalker stumbles back towards the door and his partner follows as though bungee-corded along, running his baton percussively along a shelf of rice cookers. “Expect a bill,” Tethi snarls, as the door closes — and locks — behind them. For a minute I’m not even there. He holds her defensively, panting, expelling adrenaline. In truth, he looks more shaken than Min, who is merely surveying the damage with double-precision dismay.</p>
<p class="p1">“What are you doing, pretending to be a professor?” She ducks out of his embrace, smacks the back of his head with her still-gloved hand, and scans the back for a dustpan. “You’re bringing trouble to the shop, Teth.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Auntie Min.” He addresses her as <i>Min ayi</i>, with considerable disbelief but not an ounce of disrespect. “<i>I’m</i> bringing trouble to the shop?”</p>
<p class="p1">“I watched this sweet young woman sit outside in the rain waiting for, ahem, Dr. Zhang Peifeng.” She pronounces the name musically. “I <i>saw</i> that name on one of those N-1 licenses. Why do you do this? <i>They</i> are one thing,<i> them </i>I can deal with” — she points out the door — “but it is the <i>height</i> of <i>foolishness</i> to drag a Fudan professor into your <i>schemes!</i>” She turns to me, the fury draining so quickly from her face that I have to laugh. “Are you all right, dear?”</p>
<p class="p1">Tethi finally turns his eyes to me. I see that a lot has accumulated there since we last met: a surplus of neikotic debris, for one, and a deficit of sleep. But a small, weary smile appears symmetrically on our faces. Because, surely, each of us are dead certain the other is thinking the same thing: <i>Son of a bitch, I should have known!</i></p>
