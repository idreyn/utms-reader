<p class="p1">The shopkeeper reserved all their care for these smoothly metallic teardrops, two dozen total, each in its own foam-lined case. I never noticed from ground level how much they vary in shape. But they’re all the size of a hand fruit, with the same basic structure. The tapered side has an inlet for CAT-5. The bulbous end hides the lens behind mirrored coating. It’s stamped with the blind-eye that has become synonymous with Shanghai.</p>
<p class="p2">“Get a load of the serial numbers.” A quiet voice startles me, emerging from the back through thick plastic drapes. The laoban is a woman just past the crest of middle age, with a sharp chin, weathered features, a pleasant crinkle around the eye. Her hair is in short curls, and now she plucks lilac-rimmed spectacles from a chain around her neck. “Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-five-seven-nine,” she reads fondly off the leftmost Mirror Sea camera. She speaks so softly that I have to lean in to make this out. “This is a prototype from the the Century Park pilot. But, count the digits — they had ambitions.”</p>
<p class="p2">Her name tag says Min, but...<i>this woman is Zhang Peifeng.</i> She must be. Or rather she has the man’s N-1 license, and is using it to log into the Soup and contact Deng. The cameras, the weirdly stilted messages, the misdirection, it all adds up to something like this. I consider whether to make the accusation, or come clean myself. And then — despite my purpose here, despite everything, I ask: “Can I hold it?”</p>
<p class="p2">I expect her to laugh me off, but she nods solemnly and fetches a pair of microfiber gloves for each of us. “They had a real problem with fingerprints at first. The hash is sensitive to patterns like that — careful, <i>careful</i>,” she mutters, placing it into my hands. It has real heft, maybe double what I expected. “Here, take the front and give it a twist.”</p>
<p class="p2">I do, gingerly, feeling three tiny clicks and a satisfying counterclockwise whir. Then, from a seam unseen, the hemispherical cap falls into my hand. There’s a milky-quartz dragonfly eye behind it, or that’s how it looks, hundreds of nearly opaque facets that let light play through them only along intricate, rainbow-flecked micrometer grooves. An optical implementation of the Lam-Waldmann hash, carved by laser into real quartz. For the architects of the Mirror Sea, there could be no second-guessing the anonymizing properties of their surveillance system. A conventional lens, with the hash running in software behind it, would never win the public’s trust.</p>
<p class="p2">From a locked box beneath the cabinet, she produces a truly ancient LCD monitor no wider than my hand. She clips a CAT-5 cable into the camera and it beeps once. “Now look.”</p>
<p class="p2">I gasp softly when I see what appears onscreen. It has depth, this jagged and concentric formation. It reflects faint hints of Min’s Miscellaneous in the color, texture, and geometry of its facets. I would say it’s kaleidoscopic, but there’s a way in which it’s precisely not: while a kaleidoscope is sensitive to tiny movements, the Lam-Waldmann Hash of the store’s interior barely changes as I swing the camera around. I point the lens at the shopkeeper; she raises an eyebrow, but appears only as a dark bloom on the peaks of larger waves. After a while she gestures for the camera back.</p>
<p class="p2">“I’ll part with it for forty thousand ping.” She smiles at my nervous laughter. “But not lightly, and not for a stranger. It serves me better as a conversation piece, anyway. So what can I really do for you?”</p>
<p class="p2">“I’m looking for Dr. Zhang Peifeng.” I steady myself. I make it a statement and not a question, and scan her politely bemused eyes for recognition. “I — he — we talked on the —”</p>
<p class="p2">The door chimes open. She saw it happening, but too late, one hand stowing the monitor and the other reaching fruitlessly for a remote to lock the door. Two men in uniforms the color of impending rain stride down the middle aisle, eyeing the stock of cameras with evident disapproval. Min takes me by both shoulders and presses me to the floor. <i>“Go,” </i>she mouths. I retreat to the storeroom on hands and knees, trying not to rustle the clear plastic curtains.</p>
<p class="p2">“Summer sale’s over,” Min’s voice comes muffled through the plastic. “And I’ll remind you every one of these cameras was bought on clearnet auction. Did you boys lose your copy of the receipts?”</p>
<p class="p2">“Hardly,” one of the Weather Bureau agents cuts her off. The synthesizer at his larynx makes it impossible to form any lasting impression of his voice. “We’re tracing a purchase. Local. Guy would’ve come through here. Would have needed equipment that you happen to sell.”</p>
<p class="p2">“Have you tried taking that thing off your eyes?” Min suggests sweetly. “It might help.”</p>
<p class="p2">“At approximately quarter to one on the morning of 27 August,” begins the other agent, “the Weather Bureau detected an unauthorized incursion into a class-three co-braid of Mirror Sea feeds belonging, variously, to Suowei Financial, Paracoin Technologies Limited, Beidou New Media Holdings, Fudan University, Fengzhen Ward...” He can’t get it all out in one breath, and the synthesizer makes a rattling gasp. “...Liangjiazhai Ward, Pengpu Ward...”</p>
<p class="p2">“Yes, yes, and now the mystery party is slurping it all up. You boys must be new around here, then — you’ll forgive my trouble in telling you apart? This is no great mystery. What I would do, is head up the street to Wu Ke Nai He. I would politely ask the proprietors if they’ve put a tap on this particular braid — like they’ve done with every other Mirror Sea feed this side of the river.” She tuts. “Though you won’t get in dressed like that.”</p>
<p class="p2">“It’s not the Chalkers or their nightclub. The access patterns are markedly distinct.”</p>
<p class="p2">Min’s heels click as she steps around the counter. “Why don’t you tell me more directly what you’re looking for?”</p>
<p class="p2">A pause. “Why don’t you let us back there to check your records?”</p>
<p class="p2">Min peers back into the dim storeroom, and she makes eye contact, but not with me. The shock that <i>someone else is back here</i> sends me back onto one ass cheek — and then the other, when I realize <i>I recognize him.</i> Frantically donning a cheap, vaguely offensive Chalker costume, pulling the glossy white mask over his face. It’s Mbetethi. Tethi. Whatever.</p>
<p class="p2">He puts a finger to his lips: <i>Shhhh.</i></p>
<p class="p2">Not that I could shriek anyway. Lord knows I tried, and what came out was a little teakettle <i>eek.</i></p>
<p class="p2">With a telescoping baton, with metronomic four-four precision, one of the Bureau’s agents begins to break things. Tethi shakes his head with evident self-disgust, then steps through the curtain with a billowing flourish of black robes. <i>“She’s ours,”</i> he rasps, in a TV-ready Chalker voice. He clears the counter and steps into the fray. <i>“Go.”</i></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Bureau’s agents exchange glances. The closer one draws his vialgun, but can’t quite muster the guts to raise it. “</span><span class="s2">By the authority of the Special Provision for Psychological Safety, Ward Council Edict 131,” he insists in shaky synthvox, “you are hereby under arrest —”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><i>“We will have you as our own,” </i>proclaims Tethi, stretching out a robed arm. His voice is unrecognizable, almost backwards, speaking on the inhale. <i>“Mine is not the hand that holds the Chalk.” </i>When he keys Min’s remote the monitors flare with glimpses of the Mirror Sea and the grate begins to close, and, oh! The lights flicker! The effect is classic, but a little too clean. <i>“Mine is not the hand that binds you to the pattern in the sunlight, the pattern in the salt...”</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">I always assumed the Chalker’s Binding was a fabrication invented to sell tea towels to tourists in Tianzifang. But the Weather Bureau appears to think otherwise. The agent in Tethi’s clutches </span>stumbles back towards the door and his partner follows as though bungee-corded along, running his baton percussively along a shelf of rice cookers. “Expect a bill,” Tethi snarls, as the grate crashes down behind them. For a minute I’m not even there. He holds Min defensively, panting, expelling adrenaline. In truth, he looks more shaken than she does. Min merely surveys the damage with double-precision dismay.</p>
<p class="p2">“What are you doing, pretending to be a professor?” She ducks out of his embrace, smacks the back of his head with her still-gloved hand, and scans the back for a dustpan. “You’re bringing trouble to the shop, Teth.”</p>
<p class="p2">“Auntie Min.” He addresses her as <i>Min ayi</i>, with considerable disbelief but not an ounce of disrespect. He stows the mask and wipes sweat from his brow. “<i>I’m</i> bringing trouble to the shop?”</p>
<p class="p2">“This sweet young woman came in asking for a mister Dr. Zhang Peifeng.” She pronounces the name musically. “I <i>saw</i> that name on one of those N-1 licenses. Why do you do this? <i>They</i> are one thing,<i> them </i>I can deal with” — she points out the door — “but it is the <i>height</i> of <i>foolishness</i> to drag a Fudan professor into your <i>schemes!</i>” She turns to me, the fury draining so quickly from her face that I have to laugh. “Are you all right, dear?”</p>
<p class="p2">A lot has accumulated in Tethi’s eyes since we last met: a deficit of sleep, for one, and a surplus of neikotic debris. We stare each other down for a while, and when we tire of that, a the same small, weary smile appears on both our faces. No doubt both thinking the very same thing: <i>I should have known!</i></p>
