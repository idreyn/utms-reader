<p class="p1">When I told Dr. Zhang that I wanted to meet in a public place, this isn’t exactly what I had in mind.</p>
<p class="p1">There are, it transpires, two New Prosperity Shopping Centers near Fudan University. The newer one lies just northwest of campus, and looks from a distance like a bathtub. Arriving early, I cased the outside, watching bubbles cascading ivy-like down the translucent walls, half-expecting an enormous dangling arm. I spent five cheerful minutes with a grass-jelly tea in a bustling central cafeteria, before I realized that this is not the place.</p>
<p class="p1">The <i>old </i>New Prosperity is further west in Fengzhen Ward. In photos I can just make out Min’s Miscellaneous Electronics, Dr. Zhang’s reference point. I guess I can’t be mad at the guy. He looks about a million years old in his Fudan headshot, and in his heyday this might have been the spot. But — <i>fuck</i>. With ten minutes before our meeting, I hustle upstream against the remaining daylight, brushing against entire soccer teams, passing dormitory towers each big enough for an entire YINS undergraduate class . The wardgates are in a dark, sodium-lit space under the Yixian Road overpass. I tap; the machines grind for a second, sampling the ward-trail off my card. Then the gate issues an angry buzzing noise, echoing off the rough concrete walls of the checkpoint.</p>
<p class="p1">DENIED (0x1E) PATH LENGTH EXCEEDED — SEE ATTENDANT</p>
<p class="p1">There’s no attendant. The booth is empty; the wardboard screens are shattered. I have an app for this, though, and it tells me that Fengzhen and Xietu South are opposed on some Ward Council edict, caught in an great hairball of wards refusing their tokens to each others’ residents. So if I want some FZN, I can trade for it on the open market. Or...</p>
<p class="p1">Three figures in billowing black tentcloaks appear at speed, faces painted: delicate black lines on a stark white field. Without slowing down, they each pick a gate. Taking the card reader as a suggestion — no, wait, as a foothold — they grab the plexiglass gates’ top edges and sail over in silent unison. <i>If they look like Chalkers, they’re probably not. </i>This is my rule, and that, just now, looked a little like cosplay. Only there was something entirely too uniform about their motion. It was so quiet, so fluid, that it was barely a disturbance; I almost missed it, hunched over my trading app.</p>
<p class="p1">With no experience and no gecko gloves, the climb takes me longer. Awkwardly straddling the top, I consider what might happen if I were spotted; downtown is one thing, but if you’re sneaking into a mid-ring residential ward, you’d better have friends there. But the blind-eye winks encouragingly from the cameras above: <i>go on, do your thing. I’m not really watching</i>. I land, all wrong, in Fengzhen Ward, and no one saw me come through. Five past the hour. The towers are squat, peeling, off-white, redeemed by balconies overflowing with laundry and starlinks and greenery. The magnolias, half-blighted but too precious to spare, are ringed with cytogenic spray-foam and sprout synthetic limbs. Dusk falls behind dense power-line thickets. Quiet, overly so, save for the last of the cicadas and my own breath, my own footfall.</p>
<p class="p1">Quarter past. Old New Prosperity Shopping Center is a simple structure, a maze of indoor stalls ringing a square courtyard. Pigeons hoard the remaining daylight atop the dusty, angular skylights, and chickens strut around in old skincare boutiques. Fenced sneakers line the walls of what used to be a moped showroom. The public safety checkpoint is a converted cell phone store, and the redlights are all on their phones. The word that comes to mind is <i>carapace</i>. But an inflatable, visor-wearing pig still advertises a children’s tiyan-guan, and the laoban of a cerulean-tiled fishmart gives me a look like <i>I will defend you with this broom. </i>The courtyard is empty when I arrive. I’m fifteen minutes late, but I’m meeting an old-time academic; those are rookie numbers. I order some fish balls (why wait hungry?) and eat them with the slow, dignified air of someone named Dr. Zhang Peifeng.</p>
<p class="p1">Who never comes. I linger another thirty minutes, listening to the grates go down, counting on one hand the stars I can see in my rectangle of sky. A passing raincloud sends me under an arcade of rounded concrete. Figures lope by, weary with the day’s business, a world away from the Fudan Applied Neikotics department. When the only light I can see is from the mottled red-and-white sign of Min’s Miscellaneous Electronics, it occurs to me that I may have made a mistake. Only then do I look past the LED tickers all advertising themselves, and notice what else is in the window. Arranged in profile on white wire shelves, prices dangling from neon tags, are cameras. Yeah. That kind.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">* * *</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The door chimes Infrasong as I step inside, sending my spine tingling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s dim halogen, floor to ceiling pegboard shelving, and maybe miscellaneous is an understatement. Blenders and water heaters are stocked between factory-reject TPU arrays and stadium-grade quasigram projectors. A row of plastic tubs brims with voxelite pilfered from the city’s trading floors, three eggs for twenty ping. But a familiar iridescence draws my eye, and then my whole self, to the glass display case in the back.</p>
<p class="p1">“Get a load of the serial numbers,” suggests a quiet voice, emerging from the back through thick plastic drapes. The laoban is a woman just past the crest of middle age, with a sharp chin, weathered features, a pleasant crinkle around the eye. Her hair is buzzed perfunctorily short. “Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-five-seven-nine,” she reads fondly off the leftmost Mirror Sea camera. She speaks so softly that I have to lean in to make this out. “This is a prototype from the the Century Park pilot. But, count the digits — they had ambitions.”</p>
<p class="p1">This woman is Zhang Peifeng, I realize. Or rather she has his N-1 license, and is logging into the Soup with it. The cameras, the weirdly stilted messages to an old colleague, it all makes a weird kind of sense. I consider how to introduce myself, and then — despite myself, despite my purpose here, I ask: “Can I hold it?”</p>
<p class="p1">I expect her to laugh me off, but she nods solemnly and fetches a pair of microfiber gloves for each of us. “They had a real problem with fingerprints at first. The hash is sensitive to patterns like that — careful, <i>careful</i>,” she mutters, placing it into my hands. It has real heft, maybe double what I expected. “Here, take the front and give it a twist.”</p>
<p class="p1">I do, gingerly, feeling three tiny clicks and a satisfying counterclockwise whir. Then, from a seam unseen, the hemispherical cap falls into my hand. There’s a milky-quartz dragonfly eye behind it, or that’s how it looks, hundreds of nearly opaque facets that let light play through them only along intricate, rainbow-flecked micrometer grooves. An optical implementation of the Lam-Waldmann hash, carved by laser into real quartz. For the architects of the Mirror Sea, there could be no second-guessing the anonymizing properties of their surveillance system. A conventional lens, with the hash running in software behind it, would never win the public’s trust.</p>
<p class="p1">She hesitates now, leaning around me to peer out at the deserted, unlit courtyard. From a locked box beneath the cabinet, she produces a truly ancient CRT monitor no wider than my hand. She looks me over, once, twice, and then asks, “would you like to see?”</p>
<p class="p1">By now I know that I should reflexively answer <i>no</i> to this question. But I didn’t come all this way to look away. I nod, and she looks up, out the window again, and back at me. Satisfied, she digs for a power cable. It occurs to me that since entering Fengzhen Ward I haven’t seen a single Mirror Sea display. Not on the walls, not embedded in the sidewalks, not even on a cheap LCD next to a sushi-counter fish tank. Something half-dawns on me, prickling my neck, <i>but if she thinks it’</i>s safe...and she clips a CAT-5 cable into the camera and it beeps once. “Now look.”</p>
<p class="p1">I gasp softly when I see the image that appears on the screen behind the counter. It has depth, this jagged and concentric formation, with just faint hints of Min’s Miscellaneous reflected not just in the color and texture of the facets, but their geometry too. I would say it’s kaleidoscopic, but there’s a way in which it’s precisely not: while a kaleidoscope is sensitive to tiny movements, the Lam-Waldmann Hash of the store’s interior barely changes as I swing the camera around. I point the lens at the shopkeeper; she raises an eyebrow, but appears only as a dark bloom on the peaks of larger waves. After a while she gestures for the camera back.</p>
<p class="p1">“I’ll part with it for forty thousand ping.” She smiles at my nervous laughter. “But not lightly, and not for a stranger. It serves me better as a conversation piece, anyway. So what can I really do for you?”</p>
<p class="p1">“I’m looking for Dr. Zhang Peifeng.” I steady myself. I make it a statement and not a question, and scan her politely bemused eyes for some recognition. “I — he — we talked on the —”</p>
<p class="p1">The door crashes open. She saw it happening, but too late, one hand stowing the monitor and the other reaching fruitlessly for a remote to lock the door. Two tall, black-clad figures stride down the center aisle in perfect unison, and I have the horrible sense that something alien watches us through the fixed parallax of their four beady eyes. <i>But that’s the wrong number of eyes.</i> A three-by-three diamond formation of stylized eyes is painted — no, tattooed — onto their chalk-white foreheads. They blink in the strangest sort of way: I realize that with no trouble at all I can convince myself that they’re individually either open or closed. I know who they are. I just never believed they existed.</p>
<p class="p1">The Chalkers aren’t a monolith. Their disagreements play out on the walls, just under our noses. Their affiliations are — not to put too fine a point on it — as ephemeral and illegible as anything you’d find in the Mirror Sea. But there are old ways to be kept. Beliefs, root-level and bone-dry, to be kept in a deeply parabolic stillness and silence. And the Nine-Eyes keep them, in their triple-point redoubts, studded with Mirror Sea cameras but utterly devoid of Mirror Sea displays. <i>Because —</i> the thought prickles my from neck into my shoulders — <i>because they don’t need them, any more than a fish needs a snorkel. </i>No, that’s not quite right. <i>Any more than the ocean needs a snorkel.</i></p>
<p class="p1">“You looked,” one of them intones. It would be funny in a different situation, the way his voice cracks, almost squeaks, from extended disuse. They both speak at the same time.<i> “We just saw you looking.”</i> The words come with — no, the words <i>are</i> a tightening grasp, choking me into a tight loop of only-just-memory, of gazing into the output of that single camera. I grip the glass countertop, ripping my gaze back towards the woman, who I’ve decided must be Min. Her face is not totally devoid of fear, but there’s a wild, thrilled amusement in there, too. Also a gradation of annoyance. Most likely this has happened before.</p>
<p class="p1">“Our arrangement has been in place for a long time.” She emphasizes those last two words, as though speaking for the record, or for an unseen observer. “I can’t sell just to you. The shop won’t survive. And people need to see —”</p>
<p class="p1"><i>“Too close. Too often.” </i>They redouble their insistence, the words growing convex. <i>“Not careful. And at night.”</i></p>
<p class="p1">With a telescoping baton, with metronomic four-four precision, one of them begins to break things. The other leans down towards Min, his forehead in her face, her eyes locked into something I can’t see. Whatever fury is irradiating her, it exists at such a scale that these men are mere pinholes. Maybe that’s what she finds amusing. But she sighs, infuriated, as the Nine-Eye palms her antique camera. “We’re taking this. No sale.”</p>
<p class="p1">“The fuck you are,” comes a voice from the back. A voice — my head spins wildly, drowning in the perfectly periodic crashing sounds coming from the aisles — a voice that I <i>recognize</i>. A plastic curtain behind the counter parts, and there is Mbetethi Okeme. Tethi. Whatever. “Put it down and go.”</p>
<p class="p1">Two things: Tethi is taller than this Chalker, which counts for something, and his gaze is positively blazing with Sunflower Sieve debris. I wouldn’t call it a controlled burn, but he’s got a mental harness or two around it — I see him smile when it whips in a direction I can only describe as outwards. He clears the counter fluidly and stings the closer Nine-Eyes with what a small and possibly homemade taser. The sound it makes, the <i>smell</i> it makes, should have sent the man writhing to the floor. But he only peers back at Tethi with timid, almost pathetic surprise.</p>
<p class="p1"><i>“Go,”</i> Tethi shouts again. “You need us here. This the arrangement.” To my astonishment, they do. The stung Chalker stumbles back towards the door and his partner follows as though bungee-corded along, running his baton percussively along a shelf of rice cookers. “Expect a bill,” Tethi snarls, as the door closes — and locks — behind them. For a minute I’m not even there. He holds her defensively, panting, expelling adrenaline. In fact, he looks more shaken than Min, who is merely surveying the damage with double-precision dismay.</p>
<p class="p1">“What are you doing, pretending to be a professor?” She ducks out of his embrace, smacks him on the back of the head, and scans the back for a dustpan. “You’re bringing trouble to the shop, Teth.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Auntie Min.” He addresses her as <i>Min ayi</i>, with considerable disbelief but not an ounce of disrespect. “<i>I’m</i> bringing trouble to the shop?”</p>
<p class="p1">“I watched this sweet young woman sit outside in the rain waiting for, ahem, Dr. Zhang Peifeng.” She pronounces the name musically. “I <i>saw</i> that name on one of those N-1 licenses. Why do you do this? <i>They</i> are one thing, <i>they </i>I can deal with” — she points out the door — “but it is the <i>height</i> of <i>foolishness</i> to drag a Fudan professor into your <i>schemes!</i>” She turns to me, the fury draining so quickly from her face that I have to laugh. “Are you all right, dear?”</p>
<p class="p1">Tethi finally turns his eyes to me. I see that a lot has accumulated there since we last met: a surplus of neikotic debris, for one, and a deficit of sleep. But a small, symmetrical smile claws upstream onto both our faces. Because, surely, both of us are dead certain the other is thinking the same thing: <i>Son of a bitch, I should have known!</i></p>
