<p class="p1">Sunflower-I. <i>Sunflower One.</i></p>
<p class="p1">I keep putting the damn thing down on my bedsheets and then picking it back up. I run my fingers over it as though its stitched ridges might offer some essential clue. The sunflower it depicts is in full, stylized bloom, with enough detail to make out the spiral of seeds in the center. It all suggests some military or spacefaring origin, and I find myself searching the web for the phrase:<i> sunflower-I. sunflower program deng jinghan.</i> There are literally one million results on the Soup, of course, and the only way to filter out the Siev-related stuff is to sort oldest-first. There was a strongwave detector called Sunflower on a Jupiter mission a few years back. There’s a symmetry group that mathematicians have given the same name…</p>
<p class="p1">I plug in <i>sunflower fudan university</i>. Nothing.</p>
<p class="p1"><i>sunflower deng jinghan</i> is a mess. There are papers claiming to have co-authored the Sunflower Sieve with Deng Jinghan four whole years ago. This stops my heart for a second, until I peek at the signed timestamps: they’re from more like four hours ago. Besides, Deng and I were back at Stanford then. The Soup is rife with malicious actors, and confidence in anything comes only with consensus, with very large numbers.</p>
<p class="p1">Reluctantly I type in plain old <i>Deng Jinghan. </i>My finger hovers over the Enter key, like an accusation, or like a gavel.</p>
<p class="p1">She ranks as the #9 all-time most cited author on the Soup. Her affiliation and ORCID and bokeh-framed YINS headshot come with a big fat green checkmark. I flip through her old work, but I’ve seen all this before. Back at Stanford I devoured it in weeks. I sort back-to-front, scrolling past hundreds of papers until I arrive at her latest, my first: <i>A Generalized Inversion for Sunflower Sieve debris.</i> There are already 58 comments, most “hidden by author” for thickening the Soup with more bold-faced lies.</p>
<p class="p1">One claims that Deng stole the inversion from a small neikotics firm downtown. It offers leniency if she agrees to settle quickly and privately.</p>
<p class="p1">Another trumpets a chakra-clearing technique inspired by Dr. Deng Jinghan’s body of work. (I bookmark this for later.)</p>
<p class="p1">A third offers free, high-quality neikotic pleasure protocols. Click here!</p>
<p class="p1">A fourth has a green checkmark next to the name.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b>Dr. Zhang Peifeng<br>
</b><i>Applied Neikotics - Fudan University<br>
</i>22 minutes ago<br>
<br>
I lament that you continue to ignore my messages and comments. There is something I need to show you related to the Sunflower Sieve. I urge you to check your inbox with all possible haste.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It’s easy enough to verify from Fudan’s website that Dr. Zhang Peifeng is a real guy, and that it’s really his public key on the Soup. A minor figure, sure, but a minor figure with tenure — and for days he’s been leaving comments all over Deng’s body of work, his wild-eyed urgency cresting over the course of the week. <i>I urge you to check your inbox with all possible haste.</i> My head spins. I could head back to YINS. I could break into Deng’s computer: I could pick some locks neikotically, or just guess a password. I could reply as Deng, agree to meet this Dr. Zhang, see what he has to say…</p>
<p class="p1">I force a few deep breaths. I clutch the sunflower patch: somehow I’ve gotten it through my head that it’s very old, something about the font and the stitching, but it might easily have been printed yesterday. I’m not going to break into Deng’s computer and pose as her.</p>
<p class="p1">I’m going to message this Zhang Peifeng myself.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Hello Dr. Zhang<br>
<br>
Hope this finds you well. I am Deng Jinghan’s student at YINS and her recent collaborator on <i>A Generalized Inversion for Sunflower Sieve Debris </i><span class="s1">(link)</span>. Perhaps you could fill me in on what you’d like her to see? She is too busy to check her messages sometimes but I imagine she will be interested.<br>
<br>
Respectfully yours<br>

<p class="p1">After this I try to sleep, but every so often I roll over to squint at the screen for new messages. At about four fifteen in the morning, this comes through:</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Hi Mona. Do you recognize <span class="s1">these shapes</span>?<br>
<br>

<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Clawing against a melatonin stupor, I follow the link. It’s one of Deng’s very oldest papers, titled simply: <i>A Tilespace Basis.</i> There was some long-forgotten scientific slapfight I heard about once, regarding the set of basic tile-shapes we should all agree to use in loop-lock. Deng and her colleagues lost this battle — someone explained once that her proposal was <i>very elegant, but impossible to work with</i>. They didn’t understand why that made me laugh.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Good morning Dr. Zhang<br>
Thnak you for the fast reply.</p>
<p class="p1">(My fingers are shaking)</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">I do recognize these shapes. I have worked with the Sunflower Sieve’s debris extensively, and it is clearly constructed from the tileset proposed by Deng <i>et al</i>. This comes as a great surprise to me. Outside of some school exercises, this is the only neikotic construct I have ever seen that does not use the Standard Neikotic Basis.<br>
<br>
The authors of <i>A Tilespace Basis </i>argue that their tileset is more “natural” than SNB-12, which was ultimately adopted. Perhaps it emerges naturally from elemental neikotic mechanics leveraged by the Sieve?<br>
<br>
I confess I am baffled. I would be extremely grateful for any light you could shed on this matter.<br>

<p class="p1">I rotate slowly in bed, tangling my sheets, until this comes through:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Possibly..<br>
<br>
There is something I’d like to show you and it’s easiest to explain in person. Are you available to meet me at my facility in Hewangzhai Ward<br>
<br>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">I have to check my ward map: Hewang is miles north of where I am in Xietu South, close to two of Fudan’s campuses. It’s not implausible. I peck out a reply.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">I would be delighted.<br>
Could we meet in a public place first?<br>
<br>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And this is how, the following evening, I find myself on the metro to a whole quadrant of the city that I’ve never had much occasion to visit. Earlier today I went to a neikotics clinic, one of the city’s few public ones besides YINS. In a waiting room with fewer decorative flourishes than our own, I took a seat next to a woman in a silk blouse who was studying a map of the wards, all marked up with scrawled arrows.</p>
<p class="p1">“The Sieve?” I asked, scraping my reserves of camaraderie.</p>
<p class="p1">There was something faintly sour in her expression, but it melted when she heard me. It was clear she didn’t talk to strangers much, or anyone much. There is a kind of neikonaut who never really comes back down.</p>
<p class="p1">“The Sieve,” she confirmed, testing the words in a soft voice. She gestured to her map, and I gathered that she was one of the neikonauts working on ward unification, for Blue Delta. “I — well, I can’t say much, but I suppose you’ve seen the news.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Is that going to go through?”</p>
<p class="p1">She paused, smiled for fifteen hundred milliseconds, and then looked back down at her map. In that instant I saw what her debris was doing, how she kept it tightly coiled and closely bound, like everything else in her life. I wondered if she had the faintest idea what was happening in her mind, aside from a bad headache. It would have been cruel, I decided, to tell her.</p>
<p class="p1">The clinicians called my name. I was glad they didn’t recognize it.</p>
