<p class="p1">Cai was Shanghai born and raised. Sometime after she moved in, I asked whether she could explain the city’s ward system to me. So she fetched a ceramic bowl from the cabinet, raised it head-height, and dropped it to the floor. Against the guarantees of the Japanese omni-mart that had sold it to me, it shattered into dozens of pieces. She held one pastel-toned shard up to the kitchen’s track lighting.</p>
<p class="p1">“This piece, was it created just now? Or maybe it always in the bowl? Maybe I just released it?” She raised an eyebrow ever so meaningfully and I stared back, dumbfounded. I only had three bowls now. “That’s the thing no one can agree on.”</p>
<p class="p1">Anyway, I think about that a lot. I’m thinking about it now, trying to buy HWZ on the train to Hewangzhai. My home ward of Xietu South provides me a trickle of XTN, which I hoard jealously. And I get a bundle of BWN with my semesterly stipend, which usually trades pretty well — there’s always someone, visiting scholars or what have you, who needs to visit YINS. But Beiwan Ward voted for self-annihilation in Blue Delta’s latest ward unification proposal, and Hewangzhai is retaliating by sanctioning its token. I have to launder my BWN through two neutral wardcoins to get HWZ.</p>
<p class="p1">The fategates can kinda handle all this, but they’re still running slow. At the station, I sail past the <i>Need HWZ</i> line through the <i>Have HWZ </i>gate.</p>
<p class="p1">Hewang wears a turn-of-the-century faux-brass sheen with weary pride. It prides itself, as so many residential wards do, as a normal place for normal people to live, away from all...<i>that</i>. The city up here is so many towers in so many parks, wide avenues and trickles of mopeds. No shortage of Mirror Sea cameras, but no grand meters-long displays: just peeks from the windows of FamilyMarts and sushi shops, on dingy monitors next to their own CCTV streams. No parades of young people covered in feathers or gemstones or boa constrictor skins. No skulking around in our sewers. Go away.</p>
<p class="p1">Dr. Zhang wants to meet in the food court of the New Prosperity Shopping Center, which suits me just fine. The stores ringing its edges are hardly the dazzling flagships of Xintiandi or even the charmingly dingy boutiques of Xietu. The public safety checkpoint is a converted cell phone store, and the redlights lounging inside are all heads-down on their phones. But an inflatable piglet wearing a visor advertises a children’s tiyan-guan, and the proprietor of a fishmart gives me a look like <i>I will defend you with this broom.</i> I order some fish balls — why wait hungry? — and eat them with the slow, dignified air of someone named Zhang Peifeng.</p>
<p class="p1">Who never shows up.</p>
<p class="p1">The appointed hour of six comes and goes. I fire off a message to Dr. Zhang and get no reply. The grimy skylight above me darkens, and nothing is there to replace it. There’s the periodic <i>chunk-chunk</i> of storefront grates closing as night falls on Shanghai. One more time I check a map. That’s when I see it: two hundred meters north of here, there’s another, rather older<i> </i>New Prosperity Shopping Center. Ah, fuck. This Zhang guy looks about a million years old…</p>
<p class="p1">I’ve had my eyes on the northern exit. A ward boundary, if a rather porous one; I’ve been watching people hop the turnstiles for the past hour. Everyone does this downtown, but if you’re entering an unfamiliar, middle-ring ward without its token, you’d better have friends inside. It’s only on close approach that I see that the gates are abandoned, powered down. So I keep up my sprint and sail gleefully over the barrier. I could stand to do this more often.</p>
<p class="p1">Through cracked glass double-doors now, pounding the asphalt, heading just around a narrow finger-crook bend. But the streetlights haven’t come on and the storefronts are each and every one abandoned. It’s only by camera-flash that I’m able to read the tarnished sign above the Old New Prosperity Shopping Center: a brutally rectangular layer cake of striated concrete, its faded blue paint peeling, half its windows punched out. And it’s only then, catching my breath, that I start to consider where it is I actually am.</p>
<p class="p1">Look closely at a map of Shanghai’s 216 wards — as I’m doing now, purse-lipped pinch-zooming. Peer closely at one of the points where three wards meet, and often you’ll find a tiny, greyed-out handful of blocks claimed by no one at all. During the gooey, chaotic early period of ward formation these were a huge liability: holding this territory gave your neighbors a reason, however ephemeral, to conspire against you. And so many of the triple points cleared out over the years, unclaimed and ungoverned.</p>
<p class="p1">This one, however, is not completely uninhabited.</p>
<p class="p1">If it were, I wouldn’t be feeling the prickle of hundreds of Mirror Sea cameras on my back. Several pairs of eyes to boot, I expect, peering unseen from the towering stack of apartments just across the narrow street.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">I wouldn’t be hearing the low drone, the steady drip, of aircon units. It’s <i>light</i> they eschew, not electricity. Visible light. I suspect that the streetlights are in working order, broadcasting in the infrared, all the better for the cameras to see us.</p>
<p class="p1">I wouldn’t smell someone cooking, something rich and deep and fishy. You wouldn’t think it, the way people talk about them, but even they have to eat.</p>
<p class="p1">The Chalkers aren’t a monolith. Their disagreements play out on the walls, just under our noses. Their affiliations are — not to put too fine a point on it — as ephemeral and illegible as anything you’d find in the Mirror Sea. But there are old ways to be kept. Beliefs, root-level and bone-dry, to be kept in a deeply parabolic stillness and silence. And the Nine-Eyes keep them, in their triple-point redoubts, studded with Mirror Sea cameras but utterly devoid of Mirror Sea displays. <i>Because —</i> the thought prickles my from neck into my shoulders — <i>because they don’t need them, any more than a fish needs a snorkel. </i>No, that’s not quite right. <i>Any more than the ocean needs a snorkel.</i></p>
<p class="p1">There are four sources of visible light. One, from the waxing of the moon. Two, faint and fluorescent, from the top level windows of Old New Prosperity. Three, from the LEDs blinking a silent chorus in the empty, dusted-over food court on the ground floor. And four, from the dim yellow elevator buttons.</p>
<p class="p1">I ride to the top level in darkness.</p>
