<p class="p1">WELCOME! 24 BIT COLOR/240HZ REFRESH! SHOP WINDOWS FOOD TRUCKS AND MORE...The front window of Min’s Miscellaneous Electronics is covered with LED tickers, all advertising themselves. The door chimes Infrasong as I enter, the hairs standing up on my neck. It’s dim halogen, floor to ceiling pegboard shelving, and maybe <i>miscellaneous</i> is an understatement. Blenders and water heaters are stocked between factory-reject TPU arrays and stadium-grade quasigram projectors. A row of plastic tubs brims with voxelite pilfered from the city’s trading floors, three eggs for twenty ping. But a familiar irridescence draws my eye, and then my whole self, to the glass display case in the back.</p>
<p class="p1">The shopkeeper reserved all their care for these smoothly metallic teardrops, two dozen total, each in its own foam-lined case. I never noticed from ground level how much they vary in shape. But they’re all the size of a hand fruit, with the same basic structure. The tapered side has an inlet for CAT-5. The bulbous end hides the lens, of course, behind mirrored coating. It’s stamped with the blind-eye symbol that has become synonymous with Shanghai. <i>Do your thing,</i> it suggests. <i>I’m not watching. Not really.</i></p>
<p class="p1">“Get a load of the serial numbers,” suggests a very soft voice, emerging from the back through thick plastic drapes. The laoban is a woman just past the crest of middle age, with a sharp chin, weathered features, a pleasant crinkle around the eye. Her hair is buzzed perfunctorily short. Oh, and every last millimeter of her skin dances with tight coils of faded sigils. On her forehead, a tattooed diamond matrix of nine eyes. They open and close in response to something I cannot see.</p>
<p class="p1">“Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-five-seven-nine,” she reads fondly off the leftmost Mirror Sea camera. She speaks so softly that I have to lean in to make this out. “This is a prototype from the the Century Park pilot. But, count the digits — they had ambitions.”</p>
<p class="p1"><i>This woman is Zhang Peifeng</i>, I realize. She probably created him from scratch, as a foothold for the Nine-Eyes at Fudan. But despite myself, despite my purpose here, despite everything, I gesture to the camera and ask: “Can I hold it?”</p>
<p class="p1">I expect her to laugh me off, but she nods solemnly and fetches a pair of microfiber gloves for each of us. “They had a real problem with fingerprints at first. The hash is sensitive to patterns like that — careful, <i>careful,</i>” she mutters, placing it into my hands. It has real heft, maybe double what I expected. “Here, take the front and give it a twist.”</p>
<p class="p1">I do, gingerly, feeling three tiny clicks and a satisfying counterclockwise whir. Then, from a seam unseen, the hemispherical cap falls into my hand. There’s a milky-quartz dragonfly eye behind it, or that’s how it looks, hundreds of nearly opaque facets that let light play through them only along intricate, rainbow-flecked micrometer grooves. An optical implementation of the Lam-Waldmann hash, carved by laser into real quartz. For the architects of the Mirror Sea, there could be no second-guessing the anonymizing properties of their surveillance system. A conventional lens, with the hash running in software behind it, would never win the public’s trust.</p>
<p class="p1">She clips a CAT-5 cable into the camera and it beeps once. “Now look.”</p>
<p class="p1">I gasp softly when I see the image that appears on the screen behind the counter. It’s like...like I’m looking into a cavern of jagged crystal formations, and seeing just faint hints of Min’s Miscellaneous reflected not just in the color and texture of the facets, but their geometry too. I would say it’s kaleidoscopic, but there’s a way in which it’s precisely not: while a kaleidoscope is sensitive to tiny movements, the Lam-Waldmann Hash of the store’s interior barely changes as I swing the camera around. I point the lens at the shopkeeper; she raises an eyebrow, but appears only as a dark, wavy bloom on the peaks of larger formations.</p>
<p class="p1">The woman — Min, maybe? — gestures for the camera back. “I’ll part with it for forty thousand ping.” She smiles at my nervous laughter. “But not lightly, and not for a stranger. It serves me better as a conversation piece, anyway. So what can I really do for you?”</p>
<p class="p1">My pulse quickens. In my peripheral vision, I swear I catch those eye tattoos blinking. But when I look back at her face, they go still. “I’m looking for a Dr. Zhang Peifeng?”</p>
<p class="p1">She blinks politely and seems to ponder this.</p>
<p class="p1">“I…he and I talked…”</p>
<p class="p1">“Oh. <i>Oh.</i>” She closes her eyes, all eleven of them, and smiles. Then she turns and shouts into the back room, as though she’s been saving all her vocal strength for ths is moment: “Teth!”</p>
<p class="p1">Soon a familiar face peeks through the plastic drapes.</p>
<p class="p1">As happy to see me as ever.</p>
