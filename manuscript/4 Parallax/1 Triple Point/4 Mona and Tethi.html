<p class="p1">The back rooms are where it really gets miscellaneous. We pick our way through cardboard boxes of feather boas, lewd and faded DVD cases, and carefully sorted crates of neikotic refuse: <i>Optical-Rubidium Adapters (broken)</i>; <i>Phased array drivers (fixable)</i>; <i>USB cables (2.0).</i> Tethi leads me past a room with a fridge and a few electric burners, down half a flight of plywood stairs, and into a fairy-lit little alcove. A mattress is tucked onto a loft above a workbench. Dingy, sure. But, man, this view of distant and glittery Pudong, a narrow shot through a gauntlet of nearby towers.</p>
<p class="p1">Tethi has been drinking. From the bottle, probably, but now he rummages in a drawer for two small cups. He fills them, hands me one, and taps his to mine. It’s all nervous and perfunctory. “Does anyone know you’re here?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Dude.” I sputter through the sting of the baijiu. “That is <i>not</i> reassuring.”</p>
<p class="p1">“I mean, did you mention me — this — to her?”</p>
<p class="p1">“You’re not the only person on the Soup trying to catfish Deng Jinghan. Lotta people trying to rope her into their shit. Who <i>are</i> you, man? Why do you have Zhang Peifeng’s public key? And why is it that we keep meeting?”</p>
<p class="p1">He refills his little cup, takes a visibly unpleasant swig, and puts it aside. I can tell he’s listening for the Chalker woman, who I can hear puttering around a few rooms over. As he leans forward, I get a look behind his eyes, at the Sieve debris clawing mercilessly to get out. So he’s been isolated these few days.</p>
<p class="p1">“I need help. Dr. Deng’s, or yours, or whoever put that footnote in the paper.”</p>
<p class="p1">I pause, scouring memory, finding nothing. “What footnote?”</p>
<p class="p1">I hesitate to call the table behind Tethi his desk, because there isn’t a free inch of surface to work on. Atop a stack of oscilloscopes there’s a stack of pilfered N-1 lanyards. I see Dr. Zhang Peifeng’s in there, pried apart to extract the entropy chip inside. Nearby, a pile of papers: ring-binder trading manuals and draft-sheet schematics. He extracts a hard copy of <i>A Generalized Inversion for Sunflower Sieve Debris</i>, flips to the back. “Here.” He runs his finger through the footnotes, which I only ever skimmed. “Right here.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">[27] Some of which bear a striking resemblance to the structures in the Mirror Sea known as hyperlagmites.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Oh, shit. I missed a spot.</p>
<p class="p1">“You’re telling me</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“After that night, when the Weather Bureau arrived behind you, I really started to think you were with them. Don’t fault me. The timing was awfully suspicious. But then I saw this. And that’s one thing the Weather Bureau would never mention.”</p>
<p class="p1">There were rumors of a spat, not thoroughly contained. The Weather Bureau quietly insisting that the YINS Observatory pull <i>Hyperlagmites: The Sea at Night</i> from its theater. A popular theory suggests they compromised, leaving the best footage on the cutting room floor.</p>
<p class="p1">“Hyperlagmites? Are you telling me that’s what the Sieve debris is actually made of?”</p>
<p class="p1">“That’s what <i>you’re</i> telling <i>me</i>.” He swivels restlessly in his chair. “Isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="p1">Dr. Zhang Peifeng told me that he had something for me to see, and now I’m determined to see it. <i>Why don’t you just show me,</i> I insist, evading this way and that. So Tethi leads me down six flights of back stairwell, into the shadow-on-shadow of the streets. In the infrared non-light of the streetlamps, in the corner of my eye, I catch the chalk writhing silently on the walls. I pour conscious effort into unseeing that, electing to focus on the way my trainers catch on the cobblestones. But then he pulls out a nub of chalk and puts it to the wall of what was once a charge-swap station. “Yes and no,” he mutters, answering my unspoken question. “It’s complicated. There are layers to it.”</p>
<p class="p1">He pulls a long, left-handed stroke across the brick, slowly at first, like a thief picking for tumblers. It hooks suddenly, and there’s a received, passive quality to the slashes and arcs he draws next. The darkness around me feels formless, liquid. The shape of this street is, surely, interchangeable with another. My head spins with a smearing of position, a sharp wherewards momentum. When he’s finished, he reaches for a door that I’m fairly certain wasn’t there before.</p>
<p class="p1">Behind it, quasigraphic candles flicker along the an uneven floor, their false angles revealed in the shatterglass and moped mirrors lining the the walls. Thick cables dangle parabolically from the ceiling, emerging from grey PVC pipe stamped at regular intervals with that familiar blind-eye insignia.</p>
<p class="p1">“The Mirror Sea,” I state the obvious, starting too loud and falling quiet halfway through that, startled by the echo of my own voice.</p>
<p class="p1">“<i>A</i> Mirror Sea,” he corrects. And, sure, he does seem to be one to make such a chiding distinction. <i>The</i> Mirror Sea fell with Xia Zitian; what we have now are fragmented subnets, tidepools and shards. He runs his finger along a cable as it reaches a splice-box. “Three, actually, that have been joined together. A triple point.”</p>
<p class="p1">My mind reels, imagining all the places these cables could lead — anywhere in the city, or all the way to Suzhou. We could be tapping all the cameras in a dense hundred blocks, or a single camera apiece from countless bridges and corners and elevators. Or anything in between. All of those cameras with their particular placement and angle would together point to a particular, unique part of the Mirror Sea. I saw the view through a single camera earlier<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>—<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>not quite nothing. Perhaps only Xia Zitian knows what you’d see with all of them.</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s getting harder for regular people to access.” The lack of light helps me pick these qualities from his whisper: defensive, prideful, Francophone, and vaguely drunk. “They get what the Weather Bureau will let them see. Which is time-delayed flats and the odd quasigram. But the raw stuff…you need to be someone, or know someone.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Or fall in with the Nine-Eyes,” I venture. There’s another way to see the Sea, of course, which is to promise yourself that it’s already there, that it’s always been there. To follow the Chalk down its steepest quadratic valleys, surrendering your agency in whole.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">He makes himself busy unlocking another door, and so doesn’t respond to this, but I see his eyes flash. “So I figured, set this up, charge by the hour, don’t ask too many questions.”</p>
<p class="p1">He closes this last door and flicks a switch: sweet, visible, fluorescent light. In the back of this little room, there’s a UTMS scanner. I think. I haven’t seen anything quite this ramshackle since the one Deng hacked together at Stanford. It has all the reassuring qualities of a county fair roller coaster, but at least the EASL arrays and monitor bank look off-the-shelf. Next to the keyboard are several copies of the Sunflower Sieve egg.</p>
<p class="p1">“Do they know you’re doing this?”</p>
<p class="p1">By <i>they</i> I mean the Nine-Eyes who inhabit the triple point. Tethi shakes his head, thoroughly guilty. Min, upstairs in her store, I recall how she averted her eyes from the output of even that single camera. To watch the Sea from <i>loop-lock</i> — they’d consider that an abdication of the central faith, a turn from the sublime to the pornographic.</p>
<p class="p1">“No. They don’t. But I have to feed them somehow.” He’s flicking more switches now. He’s kicking the EASL array to free it from a bootloop. “You ever consider why the market rate of a Mirror Sea feed is so high these days? Why the Big Three are snatching them all up?”</p>
<p class="p1">I thought I had. Suowei buys feeds because that’s what Suowei does: amasses a dragon’s-lair treasury of assets, homogenizing them into the silken threads from which the parallel yuan is spun. Suowei has teams of astrologers operating lasers in space, melting asteroids that it deems inauspicious. Suowei’s reality-distortion field bulges to expand across the globe, and it’s only here in Shanghai, in its dead center, does anything they do seem remotely sane, remotely sober. Chaoyue, Paracoin — they just follow Suowei’s lead, trying to keep the triumvirate less isosceles.</p>
<p class="p1">No, I haven’t really considered it. I shake my head.</p>
<p class="p1">The scanner is booting, purring under my hand. I’m trying to find comfort in the familiar noises it’s making, but my head is throbbing, my mouth is dry.</p>
<p class="p1">“I don’t want to bias you. So I’m just going to put you into a recording. Let you see what I saw. Afterward, we can talk about it.” He clicks around popups complaining that his free trial of Kanwei Pharos is years expired. “Afterward, I’m going to ask a favor of you.”</p>
<p class="p1">I don’t like that knowing look. He seems to see how badly I want this, and how badly I need to keep that longing under control. I try to imagine I’m Cai, who does this all day, who keeps the queasy quadratic madness always at arm’s length. I channel her airy detachment.</p>
<p class="p1">“So put me in.”</p>
