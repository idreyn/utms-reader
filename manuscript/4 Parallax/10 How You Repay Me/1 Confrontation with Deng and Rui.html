<p class="p1">Tethi is not dressed for the job he wants. The YINS researchers walking past us are in athleisure and graphic tees, struggling to manage even half a hairdo. He’s in bootleg Docs, subtly iridescent dress slacks. A spotless white shirt purchased on campus. The coils of his hair are tamed back, still damp. The rhombus gemstone from his forehead is gone; I wonder what to make of this. “Tethi Okeme,” he tells Deng and Rui, sounding spritely. Maybe manic, with the lack of sleep. Deng takes his offered hand, but glances at me, bewildered.</p>
<p class="p1">“And this is a friend of yours?” I guess I can’t blame her. I’ve been ignoring her emails for a week. After my hallucination last night I’m a little afraid to look her in the eye.</p>
<p class="p1">“A colleague,” Tethi corrects, with a collegial smile.</p>
<p class="p1">“A researcher,” I add uselessly.</p>
<p class="p1">“And you have something that you want us to see.” She tries to smile back. “Well, we’re here.”</p>
<p class="p1">Deng leans away from us, arms crossed behind her head. But Rui pushes his chair forward to give Tethi an appraising look. I give him more of a grimace. <i>There’s so much we haven’t gone over. </i>It’s been ten hours since we crawled out of that tunnel, eight since we arrived at YINS, and four since I emailed Deng — <i>subject: URGENT</i> — and almost as an afterthought, cc’ed Rui. We each had a shower and ninety useless minutes in the sleep pods. And now this.</p>
<p class="p1">“Esteemed professors,” Tethi begins, layering on the butter. Some of me flinches as he aims the clicker. “Thank you for the opportunity to share our work.”</p>
