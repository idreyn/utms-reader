<p class="p1">Cai was Shanghai born and raised. Making conversation one night, I asked whether she could explain the city’s ward system to me. So she fetched a ceramic bowl from the cabinet, raised it head-height, and dropped it to the floor. Against the guarantees of the Japanese omni-mart that sold it to me, it shattered into dozens of pieces. She held one pastel-toned shard up to the kitchen’s track lighting. “This piece, was it created just now? Or maybe it always existed in the bowl? Maybe I just released it?” She raised an eyebrow ever so meaningfully and I stared back, dumbfounded. I only had three bowls now. “That’s the thing no one can agree on.”</p>
<p class="p1">Anyway, I think about that a lot. I’m thinking about it now, pinch-zooming my phone as I follow Tethi into the back. During the messiest days of ward formation, after Xia fell but before Blue Delta got a handle on things, some of the most contentious blocks in Shanghai were at the boundaries of three wards. Claiming one of these triple points was a surefire way to goad your neighbors into alliance against you, and they went unclaimed for years. Only not quite. Even now most of them are occupied by Chalkers, appearing in shrug-hatched grey on the ward map. Sure enough, there’s a triple point near Old New Prosperity, at the sharp bend of a stinking canal, no more than six blocks away.</p>
<p class="p1">The store’s back rooms are where it really gets miscellaneous. We pick our way through boxes crammed with feather boas, lewd and dusty DVDs, and all kinds of electronic refuse: <i>Optical-Rubidium Adapters (broken)</i>; <i>Phased array drivers (fixable)</i>; <i>USB cables (2.0). </i>Tethi leads me past storeroom after storeroom. One amounts to a kitchenette, full of tabletop induction burners and cube fridges, fed by daisy-chained power strips. The last door on the right bleeds blue light and bass-heavy Ulanbataar prog-shag. He lets me inside what I take to be his room.</p>
<p class="p1">“So she has you reading her mail? Is that it?”</p>
<p class="p1">It’s not that he doesn’t look happy to see me. He just doesn’t look happy. The last week has not been kind to Tethi, and I only have a faint outline of why. Still, this is his hello?</p>
<p class="p1">“I have questions too,” I insist. The adrenaline of the Nine-Eyes’ visit, the humor of the double-catfish, are melting off, leaving a weird and mirthless grin on my face that I struggle to wipe away. “You know her <i>awfully</i> well. The bit about the chamomile tea — who <i>are</i> you, man?”</p>
<p class="p1">“You know your advisor is famous all the world over, yes?” He points to a stack of books. “She is one of the great scientists of our time. I have a biography somewhere. It was probably in there.”</p>
<p class="p1">“And you fumbled the Sieve, and now you want credit. Your day in the sun.”</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s not anywhere near that simple.” It looks like he’s been drinking out of this one bottle of baijiu, but now he fetches and fills two little cups, clinks his to mine. “I suppose she doesn’t know you’re here.”</p>
<p class="p1">I drink, the sting a welcome distraction. “No,” I tell him, from the bottom of the glass. “You’re stuck with me.”</p>
<p class="p1">He stops to consider that. Nods. “I can work with that.”</p>
<p class="p1">“You could have just messaged me to begin with.”</p>
<p class="p1">“I might have. It was your footnote, after all. She told me not to.”</p>
<p class="p1">I give myself a few weary breaths to process it all. I — oh, fuck it, I reach for the bottle, but Tethi puts his hand over it. Twirls his index finger, a neikonaut’s sign for <i>loop-lock.</i> Okay then. “So you have something to show her. Or me.” I piece it together. “You’re telling me that the Sieve has something to do with the hyperlagmites in the Sea.”</p>
<p class="p1">“That’s what <i>you’re</i> telling <i>me.</i>” He looks perplexed. “Isn’t it?”</p>
