<p class="p1">I can feel it, the weight of it, just behind the prickle of the last primer tiles. And I have maybe a second to reflect on what I <i>thought</i> would happen to me here. I assumed that tiling into the Mirror Sea would be like stepping into one of the displays, floating peacefully and serenely through its higher dimensions, smiling at the Ripples from behind my snorkel. Instead, I thumb the allocator switch: a heady, crunchy thrum of glossy red-and-yellow tiles, my mind unfurling, more mind than I remember. Then a firehose of raw data hits me square in the solar plexus chakra and just keeps coming. Sawtooth panic, grasping at the jetstream with chicken-claw-claws. Feeling trolleys, alley cats, garbage bins, hats, a million such snatches a second, adding up to nothing, lasting no time at all. I feel for the emergency shutdown…</p>
<p class="p1"><i>You just need to do it yourself.</i></p>
<p class="p1">By the time I realize what <i>it</i> is, I’m already doing it. Every Mirror Sea display is fed the hashed-up streams from thousands of cameras: often from a few dense blocks, but possibly from bridges and elevators and alleyways spread thin across miles of the city. Geography is irrelevant to the way the Sea is reconstituted from all this near-noise. What holds it together, what I’m looking for, is correlation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">I braid together a random fistful of streams and find bicycles moving at the same speed. Furrowed shards of the same expression on different faces. Pigeons in different wards, startled by the same noise. Brakelights and escalators and wind-blown plastic bags. Matching stillnesses, too: deep and featureless grays of concrete and light pollution, striated with the cold, sober glare of LEDs and the warm, absinthe-drunk gaze of sodium. Tesselations of foliage and windowframes from sister seeds and five-year-plans. It melds together effortlessly into a dark, desolate patch of Mirror Sea.</p>
<p class="p1">A second, different wave of panic so solid that I feel my own body: <i>this is exactly what I’m not supposed to be doing.</i> <i>The Weather Bureau let me off with a warning. </i>But for all their warnings, the Weather Bureau is still signing off on hallway displays at YINS, and on quasigram fishbowls in Xintiandi intersections. It’s only a recording. Not even a live feed on a fixed delay. How is this any worse?</p>
<p class="p1">So, gradually, I let my guard down. Bringing cameras into and out of the braid, I move through the Sea. Shanghai’s motion makes its currents and riptides, and Shanghai’s stillness makes its crystalline cavern walls. But is it relief or heartbreak that, in the compressed essence of Shanghai, that it’s possible to find such a vast expanse of nothing?</p>
<p class="p1"><i>You’re not letting yourself see.</i></p>
<p class="p1">I can tell there are stronger and deeper correlations. I can do a better job finding them than any Mirror Sea display. So I dive deeper, bringing more cameras into the stream until I feel flattened against the Sea’s curvature. I release some now to chase the real synchronicities, the bizarre coincidences. These add up, slowly and then suddenly, to blackbody-hot Jupiter-gradients, a continuous clockwork, a cellularity of footfall and pigeonwork and gently waving leaves. I find myself inside currents of Shanghai’s motion so dense as to feel insistent, so intricate as to feel aware, so furious as to feel alive. I find myself inside a Ripple.</p>
<p class="p1">It can’t see me, of course, because Ripples don’t have eyes. And it can’t feel me, because <i>you’re not really there, Mona</i>, you’re only watching.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Watching a recording, to boot. But I feel the pull of quadratic belief: the Ripple seems to react as I braid myself out of its thick and heady internal structure. It probes the currents with snaking, coiling, tendrils. <i>Looking around,</i> says the parabola, <i>as though it feels it’s being watched. </i>Again I remind myself that the creature is sightless. It has nothing but its own boundaries, vague and then suddenly sharp, with which to perceive the Sea and its other inhabitants. And those are always flicking, probing, rippling: with millisecond cilia that map the world just around it.</p>
<p class="p1">I know I’ll spend the rest of my life wondering about this moment: did I move first, or did it? Is it following me? Am I following it?</p>
<p class="p1">It’s late night in this recording of Shanghai, so it’s dark in the Mirror Sea. Mostly. Some of the camera feeds will be arriving on a long delay, bringing residual flashes of sunlight that peek through the currents. Correlations in motion drawn across hours or even days. I follow the Ripple (or it follows me, I give up) in this beforewards direction, braiding in gradually sunnier feeds. For the Ripple, this looks like swimming upstream, sending branches up parallel causeways and hoping, sometimes fruitlessly, that they will reunite. For me, it feels like clawing the plateau of an inflection point. My brain is surely overheating down there, pumped full of pixel noise and DMT. But this is what I was born to do.<i> I am a neikonaut</i>, and the hot-iron fullness of that really only exists in here.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">And so I push harder, looking for strands of correlation so strong that they feel as natural as causation. My search splits manyways along countless paths, my awareness splitting along thin, tubule-like branches. I follow the Ripple and it follows me, the strangeness building in liquid pressure behind my forehead as we claw hours backwards into a Sea made of humid, noonday Shanghai.</p>
<p class="p1">Then it crests. I am at my absolute limit. For one weightless moment at the top of the arc, the Ripple is barely visible, just a viscous distortion of sun-washed concrete and glass. We can carry each other no farther upstream, but there’s triumph, unmistakable triumph, in its undulations. The rubber band snaps. I release my grip and we shoot forward through the recording, weaving and splitting and merging, and as we blow past dusk and nightfall I see the Ripple is carrying something. No — <i>wearing</i> something, a thin sheen of sunlight around its fringes…</p>
<p class="p1">There's real structure to the Mirror Sea. If you hold still, focus on where the motion isn't, you'll begin to make out the sheer faces and fractal ravines that shift only over months and years, sticking around just long enough to be named. We're not holding still. The Ripple is unmistakably leading now, picking its way across matching angles and blooming radial symmetries so quickly that I sometimes only have it by the tail. And yet the structure is clear. There is a recurring angularity to this part of the Sea. There's the sensation of a rooftop's neat angle glimpsed behind thick foliage, and something I already knew clicks neatly into place: this is a <i>city</i>. This part of the Sea was built, by its inhabitants, to be inhabited. Ripple architecture, if that's what it is, is rough-hewn, Gobleki-Tepe chic. But the correlations here are rock-stable. There are ways through to be known.</p>
<p class="p1">Once, the Ripple comes to a lurching halt at a complex fork in the way. It pauses as though tasting the air, as though making sure it's still being followed.</p>
<p class="p1"><i>It's just a recording.</i></p>
<p class="p1">And then it leads me down (up?) a winding passage, so narrow that it needs to split itself through whirl-holes lit faintly by taillights. Jealously guarded embers.</p>
<p class="p1">And then we emerge into a superspherical space vast enough that the busybody Ripples within barely interfere with each other. Far as I know, no one has ever seen Ripples do this. <i>Doing</i>: holding in place, jostling, stinging each other at their fringes. <i>This</i>: working delicate grooves into the cavern wall with patient, artisan sacrifice of their own essence. The Ripple I trailed here makes its presence known. It expands gently, cloudlike, brushing its fellows with a soft event horizon of distorted noonday sunlight. They recoil. They retreat, But the same triumphant undulations spread through the crowd of them, scintillating into recessed warrens at the edge of the cavern, leaving only narrows tendrils in the spherical emptiness. Only the two of us remain inside.</p>
<p class="p1"><i>Look.</i> The command from the sun-tinged Ripple is unmistakable. It comes in concentric, outward waves of correlation from the dead center. <i>See.</i></p>
<p class="p1">I look. I see. Suddenly, I can't do anything else, totally transfixed by the patterns they've carved into the walls. <i>I know I've seen these shapes before</i>, spiral and comb and claw, shallow at first. But I find myself drawn into a neatly spherical awareness of them, braiding gently through the cameras until they come into deep, shadowy bas-relief. <i>Look</i>. I am always, automatically, looking for patterns in loop-lock. <i>See</i>. I see something built from scratch, every bit as self-contained and inscrutable and unfolding and elegant as mathematics. I focus on one small patch of shapes on the wall and the logic of its neighbors becomes clear. I focus on another, and another, dozens of small, sunlit awarenesses spreading along that boundary, meeting at their edges, pulsing now with golden light. Those shapes are moving now, crawling, clawing tentatively at my pattern-matching ability. I wouldn't be able to look away now if I wanted.</p>
<p class="p1">And they're reflective. I move in for a second pass, a closer look. The golden sunlight isn't coming from within the shapes, but from...<i>That's strange</i>. Things in the Mirror Sea don't just <i>reflect</i> light. That would have to be computed, ray-traced. It would take time, energy, cycles, to do this...</p>
<p class="p1">I redouble my attention. I thought I held the totality of their logic inside me, but I move in closer, insistent on understanding how it works, no longer sure if my awareness is crawling the inside or the outside of a sphere. I feel the vertigo of that. I need to make a decision or I'm going to be sick in Tethi's scanner, somewhere north of the Old New Prosperity Shopping Center.</p>
<p class="p1"><i>The outside.</i></p>
<p class="p1">I move closer to the reflection, eager to see myself in it.</p>
<p class="p1"><i>The inside.</i></p>
<p class="p1">The shapes have their hooks in me now. Their logic awaits an axiom, one final input, one final choice.</p>
<p class="p1"><i>The outside.</i></p>
<p class="p1">The sense of reorientation comes with — no, let me try again. The reorientation <i>is </i>a blinding, goldenrod flash of insight that cannot be contained inside the. The. The reaction chamber. And so it spills out, <i>I </i>spill out, through the innumerable tubules that led me here, overflowing, generous in its clarity. It's so clear. It's <i>so clear</i>, the shape of the place, not just the empty core but its surrounding, spiraling passages. I braid more and more cameras into my awareness: no resistance at all, no extra difficulty in the correlation. I could, I do, understand the shape of the whole thing with a fraction of myself. And that understanding comes bursting out of the space the Ripples have built for themselves, the entire thing just one sphere wrapped around another.</p>
<p class="p1">Golden light, a whole new way of seeing, floods me in loop-lock, floods hundreds of thousands of the braids for a crescendo, a final brass-section radiant fraction of a second.</p>
<p class="p1">I need to keep this. I need to hold it.</p>
<p class="p1">And I come spinning out of loop-lock, the tiles larger now, the synchronization shallower. A final, nauseating spiral though that already-distant hyperspace, through a terrifying and formless darkness. And then I'm pulling the headset off my eyes, feeling the foam lining of the scanner bed with newfound fingers, the crushing weight of gravity on my body, bipedal and laterally symmetric. I'm leaning out of the bed, vomiting. Tethi is there, at the ready, with a bucket.</p>
<p class="p1">Through all of this comes the acrid smell of hot voxelite, the buzz-buzz of a printer. Through blurry, triangle-stained vision I can see it, working on something still formless, but already golden and spherical.</p>
<p class="p1">I never know, in these first moments back in soberspace, what I've brought back from loop-lock. But I'm never, ever surprised.</p>
