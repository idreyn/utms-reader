<p class="p1">Minutes pass before either of us will speak. I take little sips from a crushed bottle of water. Blood soaks my tongue, throbs just beneath the silicone port in my elbow. Golden light bathes my vision between blinks, brighter than this mildewed, half-lit little scanner room, brighter by far than the LEDs blinking on the EASL array. Tethi busies himself washing out the bucket, and then rolls his swivel chair across the grit of the floor. He sits hunched with hands balled against his forehead. He watches me with soft-eyed, attendant concern.</p>
<p class="p1">“I —”</p>
<p class="p1">“I’m sorry,” he cuts me off immediately, low and flat. “Not to have warned you, primed you, whatever. But there’s nobody I can go to. You have no idea what a relief it is that you found it too.”</p>
<p class="p1">Our eyes turn to the printer, which is still fabricating a copy of the structure I found in the Mirror Sea. Which is clearly, unmistakably, the Sunflower Sieve egg. Sober understanding spreads like ice, like poison, into my fingertips. I roll out of the scanner and hit the floor steps from the sink, where I’m sick again, trying to hold back my hair. “No, <i>no, no, no...”</i> The parabola sags. I looked too long, too hard, and now I struggle to resolve my surroundings, now the Sea rushes in. The proof of what I saw is unmistakable. It thunks softly and roundly into the printer bed. “No, you don’t understand,” I insist weakly, and then retch again. “People see things in there all the time, but it’s just delusion, it’s...” What was the word the Weather Bureau used? “It’s maladaptive...”</p>
<p class="p1">He smiles, bemused, and I’m aware now of how foolish I sound explaining the Mirror Sea to a Chalker. Maybe a Chalker? <i>It’s complicated</i>, he’d said...</p>
<p class="p1">“That’s what I thought, too.” He palms one of the Sieve eggs at the control bank. “That’s how I justified selling it. But then...well, c’mere. Let me show you.”</p>
<p class="p1">Seated at one of his monitors, Tethi checks several times that I’m okay looking at the Mirror Sea again. Partly, I’m sure, in case I vomit on his fancy mechanical keyboard. <i>It’s just a recording</i>, I insist in turn, as though that means anything now. With a handheld axial controller, he maneuvers through an on-screen recording of the Sea. His computer hums, crunching correlations. Between the off-black palette of night and the poor contrast of his salvaged monitors, it all just looks like darkness. Whatever structure I found in the Sea, I must have felt it out from the tiniest, most sensitive subtleties, from where you need more than eyes to see.</p>
<p class="p1">“This is what it looked like from down here.”</p>
<p class="p1">He inches the playback forward, through a brilliant flash of golden sunlight in the murk. He scrubs back and forth to reveal a sphericality, some coarse structure. And then it’s gone. He holds up the first Sieve egg. “And this is what I brought back. It’s like you said. You see patterns in there, and sometimes they’re useful. I didn’t think anything of it.”</p>
<p class="p1">He hands me the egg, and another copy, and lets me compare the two. They’re different. Subtly so, in the detail of the interior tubules. I catch the differences more behind my eyes than in front of them.</p>
<p class="p1">“This second one is what was leaked online.” He flashes those bright teeth, enjoying the shock on my face. “You probably thought I dropped the thing at Double Descent, didn’t you?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Obviously I did. You mean — <i>someone else</i> saw this too?”</p>
<p class="p1">He accelerates through the recording. Days pass: sunlight waxes and wanes in the Sea, over and over. Ripples flash indifferently past. “You lose subnets sometimes,” he explains, as the shape of this part of the Sea morphs suddenly. “Cameras coming on and offline all the time. No idea where they are, except that they all connect eventually to the three wards around us.” He slows the recording at another nightfall, and there’s another radial flash of daylight.</p>
<p class="p1">“They tested it a few more times,” he mutters.</p>
<p class="p1">“They <i>tested</i> it?” The pit of my stomach drops quadratically. I’m not sure if I’m ready to talk about it that way. But I know, even if I don’t really remember, what I just saw in there...</p>
<p class="p1">“And then, the night that the Sieve leaked online...”</p>
<p class="p1">Another nightfall, another golden flash. But this time the — <i>the reaction</i> — it doesn’t fade away. That little orb of sunlight in that huge, night-dark Sea stays alight, even as Tethi fast-forwards again. It’s tentative at first, like flame in wind. And then it’s fierce, like flame in wind, spreading in ragged arcs out of that small, round node, far out of frame. It spreads all at once through the funhouse-maze background of the Sea, until the entire night of it is lit with a network of tiny glowing orbs.</p>
<p class="p1">“I figured you should know. I figured you could help.”</p>
<p class="p1"><i>The Sunflower Sieve is Ripple technology. </i>The thought makes me light-headed. <i>The Sunflower Sieve is leaving debris in all of our minds, and the debris is — oh, Christ.</i></p>
<p class="p1">“You don’t know the half of it,” I say. Something rising in me, fast.</p>
<p class="p1">“What do you mean? About the debris?”</p>
<p class="p1">I don’t respond. I look him in the eyes and then just past, feeling — <i>recalling</i> a wall of something reflective, and looking at it, probing it, as the diving-bell. Trying to remember, even now, what side of some awful, ragged mirror I was on. <i>You looked too hard.</i> Something awful inside me insists that I caused this by looking, even though <i>I know</i> that doesn’t make any sense. It’s got Tethi too. It’s what he’s been trying to drink away…</p>
<p class="p1">“Mona?”</p>
<p class="p1">He catches me just before I hit the floor.</p>
