<p class="p1">In my state, the roof of Old New Prosperity is probably not the safest place to be. But the cool wind on my face is so, so nice. My eyes are closed. I’m distantly aware that I’m curled somewhat fetally on a moving blanket, but more to the point, I’m working through some shit. Everything anyone ever told me about the Ripples comes back as a needling, random-access prickle, and I force my breath steady as I recast it all through this new memory of them <i>operating machinery</i> in their own world. Their agency is supposed to be faint and illusory. Their motion is supposed to be borrowed from ours. If they can be said to be <i>doing</i> anything at all, then, they are ultimately and inevitably doing it <i>here. </i>I think for a while about how I would phrase it: something is hiding in the texture of time.</p>
<p class="p1">Throuh all this I begin to hear a periodic <i>ker-thoink. </i>Through stray, fever-slick strands of hair, I see Tethi bouncing a rubber ball against a concrete backstop. <i>Ker-thoink.</i> It ricochets off the ground, against the wall, and back into his hand. But I have become deeply unmoored, so that the cause-and-effect of ball, wall, gravity, and hand is doing a thing. A <i>stare into the dot</i> <i>and the lines will wiggle</i> thing. A <i>how do these lights get so tangled just sitting in the box</i> thing. A —</p>
<p class="p1">“Could you please stop that…” I groan, having just now sat up.</p>
<p class="p1">“Watch the ball,” Tethi tells me. Three short English words. He looks relieved to hear me up and speaking. <i>Ker-thoink.</i></p>
<p class="p1">And something about watching the ball does it. It all reels up rather imperfectly, but — <i>ker-thoink — </i>that unmoored feeling fades into the background, edged out by familiar causalities. Tethi and Mona both snap back into focus.</p>
<p class="p1">“Should have warned you. Don’t take it right to the head,” he says, gluing English to Mandarin with French. “In there you need to be perceiving things <i>obliquely,</i> yes? Not looking directly at them.”</p>
<p class="p1">“You might have warned me.”</p>
<p class="p1">“You might have warned me that you’re sensitive.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah, well. That’s what the Weather Bureau called it, too.”</p>
<p class="p1">He scowls and tenses up. “Do they know you’re here?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Jesus. No.” I tie my hair up and test my legs, wobbling over to join him. “It’s a long story.”</p>
<p class="p1">It’s not, really. I manage the whole thing in under five minutes, from Cai to the Deng Bridge to coral reefs to my apartment flooded with water. To the Huanglong caves, to the other night under Double Descent — Tethi is delightedly scandalized when he learns I followed him into the tunnels. The Sieve leak, the gleam in Yao Tongduan’s eyes as he pieced together the debris — Tethi looks crestfallen, <i>aw, he was so polite to me. </i>He isn’t surprised when I tell him what the Sunflower Sieve debris is doing.</p>
<p class="p1">“Mona — I can call you that?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Well it’s sure not Dr. Xu,” I lob back, but politely. I have the ball now and I’m very much enjoying its <i>ker-thoink.</i></p>
<p class="p1">“Mona. I said earlier I was going to ask a favor of you. So I’m just going to come right out and say it. No preamble or anything. But I think it’s justified. I think I’d do well.” He blinks. He looks pretty nervous for a Chalker, a Nine-Eyes, a hardened refugee of the Gabonese Noncompliance. “Take me to YINS.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Oh.”</p>
<p class="p1">“The Weather Bureau is on my ass. They know that someone who looks like me has been selling the Sieve. They probably assume that same someone put it online. If I stay here I’m going to bring them down on the entire Triple Point.”</p>
<p class="p1">“That was a pretty close call the other night.” The memory of it makes my heart race, and I don’t entirely dislike it. “They’re not fucking around.”</p>
<p class="p1">“I’ve had a few more since then.”</p>
<p class="p1"><i>Ker-thoink.</i></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, I mean, I can <i>take</i> you to YINS…”</p>
<p class="p1">“Introduce me to Deng Jinghan.” He holds up a hand: <i>let me finish.</i> “I’ve thought this all the way through. You’ve got the Observatory. They’ve stood up to the Weather Bureau before. You’ve got experts in neikotic safety.” He gestures a bit too graciously at me. “What you’re missing is someone who knows how to think about this stuff without getting hurt.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Dunno what you mean.” Actually, I do. But I’m very interested to hear how he puts it.</p>
<p class="p1">“I was <i>in</i> it. Min and I, we were maybe not all the way gone, but we were deep in the Chalk for a while. Now we’re living at the fringes. At the interface. I feel the pull but I know how not to get dragged in. I know the trick of seeing things both ways. That’s something you and your colleagues could use.”</p>
<p class="p1">I whip the ball at the wall, feeling relief at the predictable way it moves under familiar forces. Resenting that: wishing for a wider mind, with ample space for new ways of seeing. The ball takes a weird hop. Flies past my face and into Tethi’s outstretched palm.</p>
<p class="p1">“And I’m a hell of an engineer,” he adds. “I belong at YINS. Tell me I don’t.”</p>
<p class="p1">I scan his face for the usual twitch of smile, of self-deprecation, but why the fuck should I expect to find it? The man built a loop-lock rig from scavenged parts and wired it into the Mirror Sea. Of course he deserves to be at YINS. Probably more than I do.</p>
<p class="p1">“You know this is insane, right?”</p>
<p class="p1">“YINS was always the plan. Always the dream, maybe. But I need to get out of here before that rig of mine kills me.” He turns my way now, sees my acquiescing smile and something sunny peeks through him in turn. “I know I can’t just waltz right into a position at YINS. Tell me what I have to do. One shot to prove without a shadow of a doubt that they can use me.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah. Yeah. Wait. Hold on.” Maybe the whole thing is choking me up a little. “Hold the fuck on. You’re an electrical engineer, right? You’re good with beamformers and radios and signal processing and that shit?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah.” He kind of looks like I just mentioned his favorite snack. “Passable.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Let’s say I wanted to get a readonly net on someone’s head. Actually, a lot of people’s heads, without them realizing it. Any idea how you’d do that?”</p>
<p class="p1">He looks taken aback, but — no, wait a tick, he looks <i>in.</i> He already gets it. “Yeah.”</p>
<p class="p1">“You want to help me run an experiment?”</p>
