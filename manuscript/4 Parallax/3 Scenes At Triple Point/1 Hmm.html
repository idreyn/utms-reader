<p class="p1">The first of many things Tethi has me steal from YINS is the eerie structure that Yao built with the debris. I find it in pieces in a wastebin, underneath a sign reading <i>Label Your Voxelite Or It Will Be Recycled</i>. I bring it on the metro in an inconspicuous 30-liter trash bag. Triple Point is even spookier in the daytime. Stale, humid air; the last of the cicadas: these businesses look abandoned, but I sense motion just on the fringes of everything. Chalkers have ways of being seen only in the periphery, in vague generalities, after the fact. As soon as he closes that door, the weight of sights and sounds and smells crashes over me: the street had been bustling, practically thronged, with people. I try to stitch these impressions along their usual edges, to recall who or what I had seen out there. But they fit together in a different way than usual. They fit together along grooves made of coincidence and repetition and correlation and I —</p>
<p class="p1">“<i>Fuck,</i>” I mutter, dispelling the dark, warm, and wavy undercurrent which they all added up to. It was not a visual sensation, or an audible one. It was certainly not a smell. But for a moment it took everything I had to give.</p>
<p class="p1">“Your <i>face</i>!” He’s laughing, but as though to draw me into the joke, to make it funny instead of scary. “Don’t let it build up like that. And anyway, it won’t last long indoors.” Lips pursed, clearly reluctant to lay bare any mechanics: “Out of view of the cameras.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Right,” I reply, clearly reluctant to admit that I <i>liked</i> it.</p>
<p class="p1">Tethi brings me back to his damp little scanner room. “Convolution coprocessor.” This comes out chewily, owing to a mouth full of sachima, as he points to a new box at his workstation. “It finds correlations, in other words. The big displays in Xintiandi and the like are driven by whole rooms full of these. It’s a poor replacement for a neikonaut in the loop, but it should show us some added detail.”</p>
<p class="p1">I ground myself in my body, flexing my core and crossing my toes. He licks sugar off his fingers, pulls up the realtime view of his shards of the Mirror Sea. The bulbous little grotto that was the Sunflower Sieve egg is still there, white-hot, sun-bright. In daytime it’s harder to make out the silken rays that emanate from it: thin strands of chained, golden-onyx chanceways, sluices of correlation and coincidence spun from the finest texture of our world. And in the background, knowing what to look for, I can make out many other spherical nodules, smaller but just as bright...</p>
<p class="p1">“Look at that<i>,</i>” I gasp. A Ripple, a prismatic perturbation, winding itself around one of the connecting strands. It brushes the fringes and they brush back geckomagnetically. Its tiny corkscrew sawtooth shapes mirror the Ripple’s pulsations so perfectly that it’s hard to say which is leading the dance. Then my eye catches something startling in the background. “No, wait. Look at <i>that</i>.”</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Tethi zooms in where I’m pointing; the box on the table revs its fans in protest. Distantly, I can make out that very same image. The strand far in the background has an indistinguishable, prismatic Ripple winding around it. The two images are identical, offset just slightly in time and perspective.</p>
<p class="p1">“Communication? Teleportation? Is that what the structure is for?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Might be. But this might just be two views of the same Ripple.” He flicks the axe, holding one of its side buttons, and highlights the background section. There’s a nauseating reorientation: the entire Sea sloshes and shifts to combine the two images. With this extra resolution, the Ripple wears overtones of afternoon heat on slow downtown traffic. Tethi smiles. “Yep. You spotted something the coprocessor missed.”</p>
<p class="p1">I’ve taken his suggestion of thinking about it obliquely. But the fullness of what I’m seeing hits me anew, and now I need to look away, sit down. Tethi watches the Sea for a minute longer and then hefts the trash bag full of debris. I hear it clatter. Ah, fuck. That’s right.</p>
<p class="p1">There are no wrong answers, hot-gluing it back together. The debris is a puzzle that fits together in a million different ways. No matter how we arrange it, it converges on the same kind of skeletal hyperstructure that we just saw in the Mirror Sea. <i>What’s happening out there is happening in here.</i> The thought comes staccato between heartbeats. <i>The loop is closing, tightening, quickening.</i> The implications are obscure but nooselike, with the acrid smell of unhappy coincidence, the foreclosure of possibility into claustrophobic grooves.</p>
<p class="p1">Next to me, Tethi seems fascinated, but fundamentally unbothered. But then, this tight intertwine of <i>out there</i> and <i>in here</i> is the core delusion on which the Chalk is built. He eats this stuff for breakfast.</p>
<p class="p1">“You must have <i>some</i> idea of what it is,” I finally exclaim.</p>
<p class="p1">He doesn’t stop gluing. “And why would you say that?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Well, you want to go to YINS with this,” I press. “But if I found a mind-spanning megastructure with a twin in the Mirror Sea — if I thought the Ripples had started building something, I wouldn’t go to YINS for answers. I’d go to a Chalker. Sorry if this is offensive or whatever” — <i>really, I am, I don’t feel good at all</i> — “but the city regards you and the Ripples as one and the same, and I don’t think that’s unfounded. There must be something you know about what they’re doing in there. Some legend. Some rumor.”</p>
<p class="p1">In the half-light, the little rhombus embedded in Tethi’s forehead is lost among beads of sweat. He stops gluing and turns to adjusts an oscillating fan, leaving me to stew on what I said for a full thirty seconds.</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s not offensive. In fact, I don’t doubt that knowledge of the structure or its purpose exists here at Triple Point. But you’re mistaking me — a neikonaut, and your research partner — for a Chalker, and I ask you not to do so again. When the Chalk gives, it takes by exchange. I want <i>out</i>, Mona. I want what you have.”</p>
<p class="p1">His glare softens now. “But of course I still live here. I avail myself to their tricks. I consider them my people. So I can tell you that in this part of the Chalk, there is an aversion to what is happening in that other part of the Sea. It is regarded as furtive and foolhardy. Unlikely to succeed, likely to bring disaster.”</p>
<p class="p1"><i>Why. How.</i> I stop myself from asking aloud, but still…</p>
<p class="p1">“Please don’t ask why or how. Please understand that this is like staring directly into the sun. To know more would be trading one sense for another.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Thank you. And I’m sorry.”</p>
<p class="p1">I wish I could better convey how he wields Mandarin like a chef’s knife, the tonality meticulous, every morpheme deboned expertly for meaning.</p>
<p class="p1">“Okay.” Tension evaporates from his face, and the gentle bob that seems to permeate all of his motion returns. “You wanna come see the headsets?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">* * *</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p1">There is a <i>furtive and foolhardy</i> sense to the our own endeavor which is strongest during the day and seems to disappear entirely at night. Most mornings, Tethi texts me with a list of electronic components for me to “borrow” from YINS. I bring them in the evenings, and spend a few hours helping him crack open plastic casings and modify circuit boards. I’m pleased that this can happen on the upper floors of Old New Prosperity, in the back of Min’s Miscellaneous Electronics. I like the crossbreeze. I like the view of the skyline, how it dazzles even harder against the nearby darkness of Triple Point. I like Min, even though she never says much to me. I like the incense she burns and the intricate little bouquets of cable she makes to fill the downtime. Tethi has given her some cover story about what we’re doing, but I sense she’s still curious. I can feel her multiplex gaze bearing down on me when my back is turned.</p>
<p class="p1">He gave me the basics, in typically vague generalities: at sixteen he was dying on the streets of Shanghai, and Min took him in — into her care, and into the Chalk. Years passed, their agency and memory subsumed in ways he struggles to vocalize now. Then they found themselves with the choice to go shallow, and took it together. Now they run the store. I guess I can’t rule anything out, but she seems like a mother to him. Especially when she bursts into his workspace and chides him, in that soft, spent voice of hers, for not eating dinner. It starts to preoccupy me, whether she knows that Tethi is planning to leave, but I know better than to ask.</p>
<p class="p1">He has no such compunctions, though. It sort of breaks my heart, the way he wants to know everything about my daily life at YINS, especially when it comes to Dr. Deng.</p>
<p class="p1">“I’m telling you, she has nothing to do with it,” I insist one night. I pause, tongue between my teeth, brushing liquid metal over tiny pins. “The Observatory is in a building all the way across campus. I kinda doubt she’s ever been up there.”</p>
<p class="p1">“And I’m telling you that she <i>does</i>.” He inspects my soldering job. Nods approvingly. “She co-authored that <i>Tilespace Basis </i>paper, like, twenty years ago. Don’t you think she’d be keen to know? That the Ripples are using her shit?”</p>
<p class="p1">I look at him unhappily: <i>please, my stomach</i>. It’s still intensely nauseating for me to think about <i>Ripples, using</i>. I’ve gotten through this so far by understanding the megastructure in the Sea the way the Weather Bureau would want me to, as one big trick of the light. But then I remember the way it’s echoed in the neikotic debris. Then I remember what Tethi and I are planning — and my stomach curls inward.</p>
<p class="p1">He continues: “From what you’ve told me about her, I think she’d be rather vindicated.”</p>
<p class="p1">And I have to chuckle. It <i>is</i> funny, the way this hardened survivor of the Gabonese Noncompliance, raised in the velvet underbelly of Shanghai, is the biggest Deng Jinghan fanboy I’ve ever met. All her papers on the Soup that he spammed with comments? He’s read them, thoroughly. He’s probably done the exercises left to the reader.</p>
<p class="p1">“The debris using that old tileset. It might just be a weird coincidence.”</p>
<p class="p1">“It <i>is</i> just a coincidence.” He glances at me quizzically. “You’ve read <i>A Tilespace Basis</i>.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Would you believe I’ve skimmed it?”</p>
<p class="p1">An emerging theme is that Tethi would make a much better YINS student than me, and he’s altogether too polite to say so. “The authors argue that their tileset, how to put it, <i>spills</i> out of the mechanics of neikotics. They consider the Standard Neikotic Basis much more contrived. So if they’re right…”</p>
<p class="p1">“You’d expect it to be rediscovered, almost by chance.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Exactly.” He’s still giving me this odd look. “What were <i>you</i> thinking?”</p>
<p class="p1">It was less of a thought, and more of a feeling. A general awareness that it’s the last week of September, and Deng and I are right on schedule for our first blowout of the academic year. What he said makes me feel better, though.</p>
<p class="p1">After a quiet moment, he hands me a multimeter. “Please check pins 3, 4, 6, and 15. We should be getting 3.3 volts at each of them.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">* * *</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Tethi talks about the Chalk in terms of tides. I already knew about the way it pulls people in — I’d heard less about the symmetrical way it pushes people out, sometimes just as violently, sometimes after taking years. I don’t understand just what Tethi means when he says he and Min were in <i>just about halfway.</i> And I can only take him at his word that the triple points are the shallows, that the locals from adjacent wards even come to their night market. You tend to imagine Chalkers living hand-to-mouth on stolen mangoes and penicillin. But you also hear secondhand reports of full-blown hospitals and riverbed submarines. Stories of the eerie effortlessness with which they feed and clothe the all-comers who fall through the cracks beneath the cracks. That takes money, which takes hustlers slumming it at the event horizon, like Tethi and Min.</p>
<p class="p1">(<i>What about Min?</i> I’m still dying to ask. But still, I keep my mouth shut.)</p>
<p class="p1">He reassures me, night after night, that I’m in no danger of being subsumed into the Chalk. That it’s never really involuntary. And if I do ever feel the pull of something unwelcome, I can just duck under a canopy where the cameras can’t see. But I expect he senses something complicated in my reaction, and that’s why he walks me back to New New Prosperity every night, sees me through the defunct ward-gate. Those few minutes of darkness are the strangest: I know that we’re not alone on the street. I sense movement. I can <i>almost</i> hear voices, see faces. Gradually I come to understand that it’s my hard-won blinders, not the Chalk’s defenses, that stand between us. And so it’s only after I leave Triple Point that a wave of confused and repressed sensation crests over me: ink-thick, jet-black, bone-dry.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">* * *</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>“Did you fix it?”</i></p>
<p class="p1">When I finally meet another Chalker, I meet three. Early teens. Just about that age where the Weather Bureau stops trying to snatch you out of the Chalk, reasoning that you’ve made your choice. All in layers of old athletic wickwear, secondhand tentcloaks, gecko gloves with only a little stick left in ‘em.</p>
<p class="p1">“I didn’t think you guys were ever coming back,” Tethi tells them, overly morose. “I traded it in for a pallet of telomerase smoothies.”</p>
<p class="p1">“We <i>said </i>we were coming back,” the shortest one insists. Her Chinese comes with a thick North Korean accent.</p>
<p class="p1">“We got into a choir-bubble across the river is all.” The tallest of them I’d wager is Nigerian. He already towers over Tethi, deep-voiced but reed-skinny. “Felt our way into some clusters south-ways, . Hard to leave once you’re in it. You know how it is.”</p>
<p class="p1">“You <i>know</i> how it is,” echoes the third one indignantly. Neither short or tall, and that’s all I can say about them. Not just because I’m skulking in the elevator bank — that Chalker vagueness hasn’t worn off in the few minutes they’ve been out of view of the cameras. My gaze slides off them.</p>
<p class="p1">“Nah, I’m fucking with you.” Tethi grins and stands on his toes to reach a dark plastic box from an upper shelf. “Of course I fixed it. Refilled the fog, too.” Inside the foam-lined case is a neatly spherical quasigram projector.</p>
<p class="p1"><i>“OUR SOLAR SYSTEM,” </i>booms the speaker, when he flicks the switch.</p>
<p class="p1">“I’ve <i>seen</i> this one,” the smallest one complains. She flips through some presets:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“<i>THE MILKY WAY GALAXY —”</i></p>
<p class="p1"><i>“THE AMAZON RAINFOREST —”</i></p>
<p class="p1"><i>“THE GOBI DESERT —”</i></p>
<p class="p1"><i>“THE PACIFIC REEF BUILDERS —”</i></p>
<p class="p1"><i>“THE MIRROR SEA OF SHANGHAI —”</i></p>
<p class="p1">I learn a lot from the way they all react in the next few seconds. The one with the remote drops it and instinctually averts her eyes. The tall one flinches, but then flinches from the flinch. He seems to make a point of staring, entranced, at the projected Ripples, until Tethi blocks his view bodily. <i>“You know why,”</i> is all I can hear from their low, tense exchange.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">And, oh, great. The middle one has lost interest and is looking directly at me. “Who’s that by the elevator?”</p>
<p class="p1">“That’s...a friend of mine.” And Tethi gives me this inscrutable look.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">* * *</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I thought we said eight.”</p>
<p class="p1">He keeps glancing back to the elevator, as though waiting for more visitors. He doesn’t look unhappy, but he seems to count my early arrival against a threadbare budget for surprises. I produce a small bag of capacitors and a big bag of mantou buns, by way of apology. “There’s something you’ll want to see.”</p>
