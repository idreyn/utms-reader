<p class="p1">“Let me see it,” I shout when I come down, flipping up the hood, ripping out the tube. “Let me —”</p>
<p class="p1">I make it two steps out of the scanner, but I can’t hold back the nausea. Tethi, bless him, is holding a bucket. When I look a little better, he hands me a little bottle of water. “I’m sorry. Not to have warned you, primed you, whatever. But there’s nobody I can go to. You have no idea what a relief it is that you found it too.”</p>
<p class="p1">“No, <i>no, no, no...</i>you don’t understand,” I insist weakly. Retch again. “People see things in there all the time, but it’s just delusion, it’s...” What was the word the Weather Bureau used? “It’s maladaptive...”</p>
<p class="p1">“I thought that too, for a while. It’s how I justified selling it.” He smiles faintly, and I’m aware now of how foolish I sound explaining the Mirror Sea to a Chalker. Maybe a Chalker? <i>There are layers to it,</i> he’d said. “It’s in the printer,” he says now. “You said you wanted to see it.”</p>
<p class="p1">Another copy of the Sunflower Sieve egg thunks into the tray. Fresh, icy understanding spreads to my fingertips as I pick it up. And I pause now, reluctant, because saying it makes it real. “I meant their city. That place. I’m…it’s crazy how much I can’t remember already. I need to see it in soberspace.”</p>
<p class="p1">“I can’t. Not really.” He taps a hefty grey box near the monitor bank. “This is a convolution coprocessor. The big displays in Xintiandi rely on these to find interesting correlations. But a good neikonaut can blow a whole room of them out of the water. I’ll show you what I did see.”</p>
<p class="p1">He has a flat view of the Sea up now on one of the monitors. He flicks his wrists, panning and zooming. “Look. This was the night.” I can’t see anything, though the poor contrast of his monitor doesn’t help. Infrequently there are dim, spectral intrusions of sunlight, that’s all. “Uhh, <i>here.</i>” A dim, silent, spherical flash of gold light.</p>
<p class="p1"><i>That not anything</i>, I want to insist. <i>That doesn’t prove anything!</i> But then he plucks one of the Sieve eggs off the table with another theatrical flick. “This is what I saw and printed that night. Now, time passes, day, night, day, night…watch carefully, they test-fire it a few more times…”</p>
<p class="p1">“<i>Test-fired</i> it?”</p>
<p class="p1">The feed slows. Night falls on Shanghai, and night falls in the Sea, except for one insistent little pinprick that glows like the sun never set. And then another, and another, three more now. It grows tentatively, like a flame in wind, and then fast, like a flame in wind, until the Sea is laced with a whole network of fissures.</p>
<p class="p1">“That was the day it leaked.” And he invites me to compare the two eggs…</p>
<p class="p1">“They’re <i>different</i>,” I gasp. “Because — someone else was watching. <i>They saw it too!</i>”</p>
<p class="p1">“Ah.” He grins. “Ah! You thought I dropped it, didn’t you?”</p>
<p class="p1">I don’t smile back. I focus just past it, feeling — <i>recalling</i> a wall of something reflective, and probing it, as the diving-bell. A hollow, barely-remembered horror of wondering which side of some ragged mirror I was on. <i>You looked too hard.</i> Something awful inside me insists that I caused this, even though <i>I know</i> that doesn’t make any sense. It’s got Tethi too. It’s what he’s been trying to drink away…</p>
<p class="p1">“Mona?”</p>
<p class="p1">He catches me just before I hit the floor.</p>
