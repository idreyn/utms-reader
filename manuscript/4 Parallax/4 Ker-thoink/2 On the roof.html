<p class="p2"><i>I just need to lie down for a while.</i> My body is taking this news like an infection, and fighting it with a fever. Tethi takes me to the roof of Old New Prosperity to feel the first truly cool night of autumn. He gets me a few musty microfiber blankets and a mug of chamomile tea, which must be his idea of a joke. I don’t speak for a long time. There are old foundations inside me, chewed-through ideas of causality and correlation that must finally come down. And nothing ready to replace them. Everything I ever heard about the Ripples comes back as a needling, random-access prickle, and I recast it through this vague new memory of them <i>operating machinery</i> in their own world. Their agency is supposed to be faint and illusory. Their motion is supposed to be borrowed from ours. If they can be said to be doing anything at all, they are ultimately and inevitably doing it <i>here.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
<p class="p2">Something is hiding in the texture of time.</p>
<p class="p2">Through all this I hear a periodic <i>ker-thoink. </i>Through stray, fever-slick strands of hair, I see Tethi bouncing a rubber ball against a concrete backstop. <i>Ker-thoink.</i> It ricochets off the ground, against the wall, and back into his hand. But I have become deeply unmoored, so that the cause-and-effect of ball, wall, gravity, and hand is…doing a thing. A <i>stare into the dot</i> <i>and the lines will wiggle</i> thing. A <i>how do these lights get so tangled just sitting in the box</i> thing.</p>
<p class="p2">“Could you please stop that…” I groan, having just now sat up.</p>
<p class="p2">“Watch it move,” Tethi tells me. Three short English words. He looks relieved to hear me up and speaking. <i>Ker-thoink. </i>And something about watching the ball does it. It all reels up rather imperfectly, but — <i>ker-thoink — </i>that unmoored feeling fades into the background, edged out by familiar causalities. Tethi and Mona both snap back into focus.</p>
<p class="p2">“Should have warned you before I put you in. Don’t take it right to the head,” he says, gluing English to Mandarin by way of French. “In there you need to be perceiving things <i>obliquely,</i> yeah? Not looking directly at them.”</p>
<p class="p2">I ignore that; I have only an inkling of what he means. “It bounces<i>?</i>” I ask, choosing to keep my focus on the ball. I realize now that it’s a copy of the Sunflower Sieve. “The Ripples left us a <i>bouncy egg</i>.”</p>
<p class="p2">“Nothing in the Soup about it yet.”</p>
<p class="p2">“No one’s dropped one, I guess.”</p>
<p class="p2">“Could be your second paper.”</p>
<p class="p2">The orb hits his palm with a satisfying smack. We enjoy a pleasant minute of silence. Through an unlikely gap, through countless towers in countless parks, we have a clear view of distant and twinkling Pudong. Blurry Ripples crawl the twist of the Suowei Tower.</p>
<p class="p2">“Mona — I can call you that, yes?”</p>
<p class="p2">“Well it’s sure as shit not Dr. Xu,” I lob back, but politely. I have the egg now and I’m very much enjoying its <i>ker-thoink.</i></p>
<p class="p2">“Mona. I said earlier I was going to ask a favor of you. So I’m just going to come right out and say it. No preamble or anything. But I think it’s justified. I think I’d do well.” He blinks. He looks pretty nervous for a Chalker. For a hardened refugee of the Gabonese Noncompliance. “Take me to YINS.”</p>
<p class="p2">I offer a skeptical glance, but I’m in no hurry to shoot him down.</p>
<p class="p2">“Part one. I need you. The Nine-Eyes know that someone is watching the Sea here. The Weather Bureau is looking for someone who meets my description. I don’t know how much they know, either of them, but they’re closing in. I need to <i>leave</i>. I need the sanctuary of a neutral party. YINS. The Observatory.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><i>What about Min? </i>I want to ask, but for now I keep my mouth shut.</p>
<p class="p2">“Part two. You need me. And, and — it’s not just what I know. For all I know, the Observatory has seen it too. But I live right here at the interface. I’ve been in and I’ve come out. I know the trick of seeing both ways.” He gestures vaguely to Triple Point, and I have <i>a lot</i> of questions, but okay. “It’s a way of thinking I don’t expect YINS cultivates, if your reaction is any gauge. Sorry.”</p>
<p class="p2">“Well, you’ve clearly thought this through,” I begin. “I mean, I can <i>take</i> you to YINS…”</p>
<p class="p2">I whip the Sieve egg at the wall, relieved at the predictable way it moves under familiar forces. Resenting that: wishing for a wider mind, ample space to fit new ways of seeing as they come. The orb takes a weird hop. Flies past my face and into Tethi’s outstretched palm.</p>
<p class="p2">“And I’m a hell of an engineer,” he adds. “I belong at YINS. Tell me I don’t, or introduce me to Deng Jinghan.”</p>
<p class="p2">I scan his face for the usual twitch of smile, of self-deprecation, but why the fuck should I expect to find it? The man built a loop-lock rig from scavenged parts and wired it into the Mirror Sea. Of course he deserves to be at YINS. Probably more than I do.</p>
<p class="p2">“You know this is insane, right?”</p>
<p class="p2">“It was always the plan. Always the dream, maybe. I just need to leave this place before it kills me. I was only ever supposed to be here a week.” He turns my way now, sees my acquiescing smile and something sunny peeks through him in turn. “I can’t just waltz into a position at YINS, I know that. So tell me how to really impress them. One shot to prove they can use me. I just need the intro.”</p>
<p class="p2">“Yeah. Yeah. Wait. Hold on.” For a second there I was getting choked up, a little, maybe. But something is coming together. “Hold the fuck on. You’re an electrical engineer, right? You’re good with UTMS and beamformers and signal processing, all that good stuff?”</p>
<p class="p2">“Yeah.” He looks like I just listed the ingredients of a delicious cake. “Passable.”</p>
<p class="p2">“Let’s say I wanted to get a readonly net on someone’s head. Actually, a lot of people’s heads. Uh, without them realizing it. Any idea how you’d do that?”</p>
<p class="p2">He’s taken aback, but — no, wait a tick, he already gets it. He’s <i>in</i>. “Yeah.”</p>
<p class="p2">“Wanna help me run an experiment?”</p>
