<p class="p1">“What you’re asking is impossible,” Tethi tells me. But he says so with that one particular smile, and within hours he’s sent me a long, detailed list of parts to requisition from YINS. The first thing he wants to see is the skeletal structure that Yao assembled from neikotic debris.</p>
<p class="p1"><i>Him??</i> Tethi says over text when I tell him that story. <i>Oh damn he was so nice to me!</i> Sad face.</p>
<p class="p1">As far as Deng knows I’m taking a well-deserved break. It’s not exactly a lie, and she’s not exactly upset about it. <i>Rest up! - DJH. </i>(But she keeps sending me five papers a day with no context or subject line.) So I do have to be careful, snooping around YINS late at night. The first batch of Tethi’s parts took me through the engineering floors, where no one knows me. But creeping around the Safety floor at half past midnight, searching for Yao’s model, that’s another matter.</p>
<p class="p1"><i>Label Your Voxelite Or It Will Be Recycled, </i>reads a sign by the wastebins, and that sends me digging through a bucket of sharp, clattering pieces. Interspersed, thankfully rarely, with the odd teabag or banana peel.</p>
<p class="p1">An unexpected voice stops me cold. “If you people just marked your eggs, you wouldn’t be having these problems.”</p>
<p class="p1">The man’s name is either Pan or Pang and I feel awful that I can never remember. He’s one of the cleaners that work their way through Building 1, usually getting to the basement well past midnight. I explain what I’m looking for.</p>
<p class="p1">“That’s a hot item,” he replies, getting a frankly well-deserved chuckle out of this. “You’re a few days late to the scramble.”</p>
<p class="p1">“You’ve seen it?”</p>
<p class="p1">“I was just about to toss it the other night.” He shakes a trash bag open and gestures for me to stand aside. “Then two gals showed up. Both wanted it. One of them was a professor. Dr. Guo? Or maybe Deng? Office down the hall. The other one I’d never seen before.”</p>
<p class="p1">My spine shoots up. “Tall? Glamorous type? Blonde, like, really blonde?”</p>
<p class="p1"><i>Pfff, </i>he goes. “At YINS? Would’ve remembered that. She looked kinda nondescript. If that helps.”</p>
<p class="p1">“And who took it?”</p>
<p class="p1">“I left them to their business. Got business of my own.”</p>
<p class="p1">So that puts me in the voxelite fab at 3:15 in the morning, still re-printing our newest debris samples, periodically sticking my head out the window for air. And that makes me very tired by the time I get back to Triple Point. Tethi was up all night, too. On a desk beneath his loft, he already has breadboard prototypes. He leads me back to the scanner room. On his displays, we scan the <i>wider</i> Sea, the <i>lower </i>Sea, the <i>outer</i> Sea — we try out different names for the un-settled part, where the Ripples still appear wild and unthinking. Furtively we point out any traces we spot of the <i>inner </i>Ripples’ golden scaffolding. Sometimes we hear footsteps from passageways just below us. It stops us both cold.</p>
<p class="p1">“Look at that,” I gasp. A Ripple coils itself around a faint golden streak with apparent curiosity. The streak arcs for what seems like forever until it strikes another stellar node of their structure.</p>
<p class="p1">“No, look at <i>that</i>,” Tethi mutters. In another corner of the screen I can make out nearly the same thing happening in another corner, with eerie synchronicity.</p>
<p class="p1">“Is this what it’s for, then? Teleportation? Communication?”</p>
<p class="p1">But Tethi snorts, and taps the convolution coprocessor. “I think it’s really the same Ripple, and this thing is a piece of junk.”</p>
<p class="p1">There are no wrong answers, hot-gluing the debris together. It fits together in a million different ways, a puzzle that’s no puzzle at all. No matter how we arrange it, it converges on the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>skeletal hyperstructure the Mirror Sea. <i>What’s happening out there is happening in here.</i> The thought comes staccato between heartbeats. <i>The loop is closing, tightening, quickening.</i> The implications are obscure but nooselike, with the acrid smell of unhappy coincidence, the foreclosure of possibility into claustrophobic grooves.</p>
<p class="p1">Next to me, Tethi seems fascinated, but fundamentally unbothered. But then, this tight intertwine of <i>out there</i> and <i>in here</i> is the core delusion on which the Chalk is built. He eats this stuff for breakfast.</p>
<p class="p1">“You must have <i>some</i> idea of what it is,” I finally exclaim.</p>
<p class="p1">He doesn’t stop gluing. “And why would you say that?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Well, you want to go to YINS with this,” I press. “But if I found a mind-spanning megastructure with a twin in the Mirror Sea — if I thought the Ripples had started building something, I wouldn’t go to YINS for answers. I’d go to a Chalker.”</p>
<p class="p1">“I’m not a Chalker,” he replies. I cringe inwardly while he works a tricky joint with hot glue. But his tone remains mild. “I don’t blame you. It’s what I’d think, too. But if YINS is going to take me seriously, I need <i>you</i> to take me seriously. I am choosing to leave this place.”</p>
<p class="p1">“I’m sorry. I’m just panicking a little, is all.”</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s fine.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Really, Teth, I’m —”</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s fine.”</p>
<p class="p1">The silence that descends is comfortable, all things considered. But the structure almost doubles in size before he speaks again. “For what it’s worth, if I did know what it was, I wouldn’t be capable of telling you. That’s the tradeoff. <i>That’s </i>the Chalk.”</p>
