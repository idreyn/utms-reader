<p class="p1">“His name was Andre. My father. I — I should just talk about him? Okay, um, so. Wait, should I move another prism? Alright...here. Okay. My father. A story that they always liked to tell about him, was when he was a child, he was a real...there’s a very specific English phrase I can’t think of here. A smart child. No, way more colloquial. Whiz kid. He was a whiz kid.</p>
<p class="p1">“He came up in a little town outside Libreville. One of those little kids who is always in a book. Wore glasses he didn’t need. Always wanted to be in corduroy, yeah, exactly, like he was cultivating this professor aesthetic. Only the funny thing is he’d come to market and lean against a post all, all, all, erudite and shit, and he’d have like a comic book in his hand. I <i>know</i>. Like this little professor. But the thing is he was like, four, and he was already reading. And he grew into it.</p>
<p class="p1">“And...boop.” Tethi moves another piece from the optics kit. The lights are off, we’re on the floor, but we’re not playing the same game I learned at the Weather Bureau. This one is supposed to be collaborative, positive-sum, but honestly I’m not sure either of us understand the rules. I try for kind eyes, aiming to soften the abrasiveness of the Sieve debris. <i>Go on.</i></p>
<p class="p1">“So he was probably about eight when he started picking up econ textbooks. He was looking for <i>business </i>textbooks because now he was an eight-year-old child who walked around with a Bluetooth headset shouting at no one. But a librarian snuck something in there on the origins of money, theories of value, that kind of thing. That really got him going. Now he was an eight year old boy who could name all the currencies of Africa. And he decided to make his own.”</p>
<p class="p1">I slide an optic piece in exchange. Forcing myself not to wonder what the readonly nets around our heads are picking up, whether it’s working. I focus on the story.</p>
<p class="p1">“He just named it after himself, but honestly, the Andre is a pretty good name for a currency. It rolls off the tongue. People liked saying it. What he did was, go around to the neighbors and hand them each, I wanna say, one hundred Andre. The bills were denominated with the neighborhood pets, and he was doing them by hand so circulation was limited. He had this long-ass speech about resilience in the local economy and principled monetary policy and — I know, I know, okay, people can still do the voice, but they can’t really get the words because no one knows what he was on about! But, anyway, as he was leaving, before he hopped off the front stairs of whatever, he’d ask, <i>do you believe in the Andre</i>? And he’d make every single one of the neighbors say they did.</p>
<p class="p1">“The first transactions in Andre were definitely jokes. Like someone would come round with peak fruit, like, best fruit of the season, like, <i>you have to try this.</i> And in exchange you’d give them an Andre to quote-unquote pay them. But it took on that exact quality. It was a token of genuine appreciation, when it would have offended the other party to hand them real money The rule was that you couldn’t <i>buy</i> anything with Andre. It was like a thank you note. But it took on this glowing quality, to the point where if you were doing an odd job, you wanted that Andre, you didn’t want, I guess it was francs at the time. Because there was <i>appreciation</i> in that. I mean, I’m talking grown men.” He pauses now. “Is this right? Is this making any sense?”</p>
<p class="p1">I’m not supposed to speak, but nodding seems like not enough. “Yeah. Yeah. This is good.”</p>
<p class="p1">“So,” Tethi goes on, settling in. “The turning point was when he got a printer. He did thousands of bills and marked them with his thumbprint. There was a little inflationary crisis, but somewhere in that transition it just started getting <i>used</i> like a currency. It still had that kind of sparkle to it, and people wanted to use it to buy things for the social cohesion aspect, like my friend I am buying this from <i>you</i>. And the currency exchange downtown had a going rate! For years! Eventually the <i>hotel de ville</i> took over managing the supply, and there was this spat with the Gabonese federal government about it. But it stuck around to the point where he was in graduate school in Lagos and these loaded, these Nigerian guys from these <i>big</i> families would say, <i>my brother, we learned about you in school, </i>and they’d take him out, I mean, I’m talking bottle service, private jets, and all they wanted was for him to grease their palms with a little Andre!”</p>
<p class="p1">At this point Tethi has me in stitches. I’m struggling to maintain eye contact. I don’t know if I expect to see any Sunflower Sieve debris transfer like I told him I said I would, but hell, it’s a fun story.</p>
<p class="p1">“He came back to Gabon, and of course he was in charge of managing the transition from the franc to the eco. And I think it — I wonder all the time whether it was a coincidence that Suowei came to <i>him</i>. Because even when it was clear that the Fork was a failure, even,” his laugh takes a hard left turn here, “even when there was a fucking mob outside his building looking for his skull, he still believed in what they wanted to do. He’d point to this framed hundred-Andre bill and he said, Tethi, <i>transitions take time.</i>”</p>
<p class="p1">His voice cracks. His face falls all at once. And I wonder if he meant for this to happen for the sake of the experiment, but I don’t stop him, I hold steady eye contact, washed over by the chatter of Sieve debris. This could be working — oh, what a fucking horrible thought — this could be good data.</p>
<p class="p1">“When it all went wrong, when he — I always wanted to know, did Suowei know who they had chosen? When I came to Shanghai I went there, I wanted to ask, did...did they at least know the story?”</p>
<p class="p1">And now there are tears.</p>
