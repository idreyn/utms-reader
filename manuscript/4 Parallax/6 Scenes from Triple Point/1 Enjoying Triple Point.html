<p class="p1">Tethi talks about the Chalk in terms of tides. I already knew about the way it pulls people in — I’d heard less about the symmetrical way it pushes people out, sometimes just as violently, sometimes after taking years. I have to take him at his word that the triple points are the shallows: where you go in, where you come out. He says the locals from adjacent wards even come to their night market. You tend to imagine Chalkers living hand-to-mouth on stolen mangoes and penicillin. But you also hear of hospitals and riverbed submarines. Stories of the eerie effortlessness with which they feed and clothe the all-comers who fall through the cracks beneath the cracks. That takes money, which takes hustlers slumming it at the event horizon, like Tethi and Min.</p>
<p class="p1">I find Triple Point even spookier in the daytime: the black tarps everywhere, the stale and humid air, the last of the cicadas. For all the abandoned businesses, there is motion on the fringes of everything. Chalkers have ways of being seen only in the periphery, in vague generalities, after the fact. Sometimes I’ll get inside Old New Prosperity before an accumulation of sights and sounds and smells crashes over me: the street had been bustling, practically thronged, with people. I try to stitch these impressions along their usual edges, to recall who or what I had seen out there. But they fit together in a different way than usual. They fit together along grooves made of coincidence and repetition and correlation and —</p>
<p class="p1">The chime of Min’s door dispels this dark, warm, and wavy undercurrent, and brings me back into frame. I already can’t remember it, and surely<i> that</i> should at least be familiar? But no: loop-lock memories are gaseous and diffuse, trappable in tiny pockets. This is liquid, heavy, swirling down the drain. It was not a visual or audible sensation. It was certainly not a smell. But for a moment it took everything I had to give.</p>
<p class="p1">“Your <i>face!</i>” Tethi is laughing, but as though to draw me into the joke, to make it funny instead of scary. “Don’t let it build up like that. And anyway, it won’t last long indoors.” Lips pursed, clearly reluctant to lay bare any mechanics: “Out of view of the cameras.”</p>
<p class="p1">Indeed, the only Chalkers I ever really encounter are the ones who come into Min’s shop. Their errands bring them careening in with purposes they can no longer name or articulate. She makes them dry off in a little nook, where scalding tea and sweet cakes help snap them into their own senses. Then she primly reminds them that she sells cable and cameras, <i>sell</i> being the operative word. Others don’t cooperate: they burst in and stride up to the counter in perfect unison and demand things in a language not even Tethi can understand. They give off the horrible sense that, behind their onyx-dark Contecs, something alien watches us through their parallax. One of two things will happen here: Tethi will jump the counter, brandish a buzz baton, insist they leave. Or Min will invite them to stay.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s only when she offers me a bunk of my own that I realize just how many people are staying in the back of the store. Many are on their way out of the Chalk: I can tell by the convalescent half-glaze of their gazes, the introductions that mix up <i>I </i>and <i>you.</i> But more and more, they’re on their way way in. There are the runners-from, fleeing raw losses or deep debts and seeking only obliteration. Then there are the runners-to, jaundiced with screen-lust, feverish with desire for the real Sea, marshaling the courage to take those last few steps. They linger, for a night, or a week or — I’m beginning to piece Tethi’s story together, despite his best efforts — in one case a year, becoming useful, never quite getting around to leaving. Min offers what she can to all of them without judgement. And it doesn’t appear to strike her as strange in the least, when I show up again and again, at gradually odder hours, always with bags of goods pilfered from the YINS Neikotic Engineering floors.</p>
