<p class="p1">I like Min. She never says much, but I like the incense she burns, the feverish way she dusts, the cable bouquets she makes out of some compulsion. I like watching her and Tethi exchange their quiet affection. But I wonder about her.</p>
<p class="p1">One night she turns to me and raises an eyebrow. “Watch the counter?”</p>
<p class="p1">She pulls on a coat and leaves. When, exactly, did <i>this</i> happen? Maybe it was last night, when she pulled us out of Tethi’s room, away from our little assembly line, and served us heaping portions of fish soaked with lemon and ginger. Maybe it was the day before that, when I helped them gut a busted trash collector to extract one pricey little coil. Or the day before that, when Min and Tethi together listed twelve songs containing the word <i>California</i> — in English, Mando, and Korean all three, as my face went darker and darker red. It has been…exactly how many days?</p>
<p class="p1">All I know is I don’t mind it here. It’s quiet in a way that YINS can never manage, its walls always humming with current and coolant. The Chalkers largely hold the Sea in their hearts, in deep wells of quadratic belief, and there are relatively few Mirror Sea displays around Triple Point. The lack of jump scares on those screens is relief I didn’t know I needed. The work we’re doing is grueling, yeah. My fingers are burnt with hot plastic and solder and the shock of stray couplings. Tethi is a maestro; there are layers and layers to even simple neikotic devices that I will never again take for granted. He would do well at YINS — no, he <i>will</i> do well. Only he may have to convince me to go back with him.</p>
<p class="p1">But I can’t stay forever, and the reminder comes in the form of three Chalkers who burst through the door, late past sundown. That tends to mean trouble, and I grip the worn yellow handle of the buzz baton under the counter, completely unsure if I’m capable of using it. They stride up to the counter in their face paint and rags and —</p>
<p class="p1">“Did you fix it?” The smallest of them shouts past my shoulder to Tethi.</p>
<p class="p1">And with that, a certain illusion dissipates. These are young teenagers, barely past the age where the Weather Bureau stops trying to snatch you back out of the Chalk, reasoning that you’re old enough to make your choice.</p>
<p class="p1">“I thought you guys weren’t coming back,” Tethi tells them, overly morose. “I traded it for a pallet of teleromase smoothies.”</p>
<p class="p1">“We said we were coming back,” says the small one. As he dries off I clock that his Mandarin comes with a thick North Korean accent.</p>
<p class="p1">“We got caught up moving a choir-bubble south-ways,” insists the tall one. She sounds Nigerian, reed-skinny but already taller than Tethi. “Tough wards. Hard to know where you’re going once you’re in it. You know how it is.”</p>
<p class="p1">“You <i>know</i> how it is,” agrees the small one.</p>
<p class="p1">Tethi blinks once and then breaks into a shit-eating grin. “I am just fucking with you guys. Of course I fixed it.” He leads them to the second storeroom and pulls a clamshell case off a high shelf with a grunt. “Refilled the fog, too.”</p>
<p class="p1">I lean in the doorframe, highly amused, as pulls a children’s quasigram projector, a rubbery green spherical thing, from its foam lining. <i>“OUR SOLAR SYSTEM,” </i>booms the speaker, when he flicks the switch.</p>
<p class="p1">“I’ve <i>seen</i> this one,” the small one complains. He flips through some presets:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“<i>THE MILKY WAY GALAXY —”</i></p>
<p class="p1"><i>“THE AMAZON RAINFOREST —”</i></p>
<p class="p1"><i>“THE GOBI DESERT —”</i></p>
<p class="p1"><i>“THE PACIFIC REEF BUILDERS —”</i></p>
<p class="p1"><i>“THE MIRROR SEA OF SHANGHAI —”</i></p>
<p class="p1">“You guys,” Tethi insists. “Why don’t you watch something else for once.”</p>
<p class="p1">So two of them try slingshotting probes around the sun. The third one — well, I can’t precisely pin him down. That particular Chalker here-nor-thereness hasn’t worn off since he stepped out of the cameras, and he says nothing, reacts to little. Soon Tethi pulls him aside, down the hall, into his own room. He shoots me a look, and then another one, and only then do I understand he means me to follow. When the young Chalker is seated in his office chair, he asks, “you didn’t come for the projector, did you?”</p>
<p class="p1">The Chalker boy tries to speak and produces only round little whispers. Tethi offers him various little stimulations: a piece of chocolate, a stress ball, and eventually, reluctantly, a bright white LED to the eyes. “Are you in there?”</p>
<p class="p1">“They won’t come out,” he finally replies, low and hoarse. “Even when I’m days off the street. There’s something inside me, something flashy, something they’re too attracted to. I invite them to go, I tip out, and they only cling tighter.”</p>
<p class="p1">Sudden flashes now of loop-locked memory. “Does it feel reflective?” I ask. I’m uncertain if I should — what if that makes it somehow more salient, more real? And a chill runs down my spine, in my fingertips, when he nods.</p>
<p class="p1">Tethi drapes a readonly net over the boy’s head and mutters all sorts of reassuring things. I can totally picture him working the clinic. Now he swivels the display away so he and I can see the manifolds onscreen. And I don’t totally trust what I see there. I’ve spent so much time with it that I see those clawing spirals always in my peripheral vision. But it’s hard to argue that, fuzzy and weak though it is, the kid’s ‘folds are full of Sunflower Sieve debris.</p>
<p class="p1">“Is he a neikonaut?” I whisper.</p>
<p class="p1">“No way,” Tethi replies, panning, zooming, peering at more readouts.</p>
<p class="p1">“Then the inversion won’t take, right?”</p>
<p class="p1">“That’s supposed to be your thing,” he hisses. “But we can’t use my rig. Chalkers cannot keep secrets. If <i>any</i> of them find out what I’m doing down there, they’ll all know soon. I will be toast.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Do you see them in there?” The Chalker boy asks.</p>
<p class="p1">“Yes. I do.” Tethi steadies his voice with false cheer. It’s not an outright lie — more like, it’s impossible to tell if any of these dripping, liquid manifolds could possibly originate with a Ripple. “You should stay here for a few days until they clear out. Min can find you a bunk.” But an hour passes in which we try to pretend all is well. We offer them packs of energy bars, and he leaves with his friends, casting apologetically back to Tethi as the door chimes shut.</p>
<p class="p1">“What does this mean?” We share a long, grim look. I find myself missing Yao.</p>
<p class="p1">“It means we’re going to need more headsets.”</p>
