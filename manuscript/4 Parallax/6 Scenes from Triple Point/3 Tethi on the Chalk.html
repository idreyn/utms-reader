<p class="p1">I stay very late that night. The hours run together, the way things at Triple Point tend to do. I’m still soldering well past midnight. My tongue is between my teeth, my hand steady, running liquid metal over tiny pins.</p>
<p class="p1">“You’re going to need a CV,” I say too loudly, too suddenly. “For YINS.”</p>
<p class="p1">Tethi nods approvingly at my soldering work. Hands me the next board in exchange. “What?” He processes this a moment later. “Oh, very true. Thanks.”</p>
<p class="p1">“You’re going to need to account for the years,” I go on, head in the fumes again. “You say you’re not a Chalker. Fine. I believe you. But just how much time have you spent in there?”</p>
<p class="p1">He flicks a switch and the visor-screen in his hands goes dark. He turns the music down, hears Min puttering around just outside, and then turns it up even louder. “I don’t like talking about it.”</p>
<p class="p1">“I understand.”</p>
<p class="p1">“I <i>can’t</i> talk about it. It is categorically and precisely not possible to talk about.”</p>
<p class="p1">“If this is going to work, I need more than that.”</p>
<p class="p1">He knows I’m right. He scoots his chair, cracks his knuckles. “I told you why I came to Shanghai?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah,” I reply softy. I mean, only kind of. Only in broad strokes, through tears. His father was one of the architects of the Gabonese Fork, and Tethi fled for his life. The details fill themselves in, and they aren’t pretty.</p>
<p class="p1">“I wanted to train as a neikonaut. And I was stupid enough to think that Suowei owed me something. That they’d have a clue in the world who I was. None of that worked out.” He holds up a freshly assembled headset now. “This. There’s a reason this came to mind. <i>This</i> was the work I was able to find, selling rave gizmos outside clubs and parties. People would fuck with you. Mostly they were harmless, but out there you’re always on someone else’s turf. One night, I stepped on the wrong toes. They took my pushcart and left me in a very bad state. Left me to die.”</p>
<p class="p1">I stow the soldering iron.</p>
<p class="p1">“The thing is,” Tethi goes on, “I had no home ward. And when you have no ward alignment — you know which hospitals are going to treat you? Without a fuss, without getting the bluelights involved? Chalker hospitals. They peeled me off the ground. I recovered, and then made myself useful. I...<i>god. </i>I wish I could put it into words, I really do. Five floors and a thousand eyes. The way the wind blew through the whole building at once, how that felt...” He falls silent, looking happy about something distant. It makes me glad to see him like this. “People like to say the Chalk steals people, so as not to admit that their friend or their kin made the choice. You always make the choice.”</p>
<p class="p1">I press. “And you make the choice to leave?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Well, Min took me in.” He pauses. This percolates. “Listen, I get it. If I found a mind-spanning megastructure with a twin in the Mirror Sea...” Tethi waves his arms expansively. “If I saw the Ripples were building something, I wouldn’t go to YINS for answers. I’d go to a Chalker.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Teth...”</p>
<p class="p1">“<i>But I am choosing to leave this place.</i>” He enunciates every syllable, sliding it under the music. “I need YINS to take me seriously, and that starts with you. Can you do that?”</p>
<p class="p1">Can <i>Deng</i> do that? I’ve batted this question back and forth every night, trying to sleep. In some of my little hypnagogic puppet shows, she welcomes Tethi with open arms. <i>At last,</i> she implies, <i>a student worthy of my brilliance</i>. Other times, I’m the cat and he’s what I dragged in. Mostly I turn that patch over and over in my hands, and I sit with the fact that there’s something I’m missing.</p>
<p class="p1">“Mona? Can you?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Yes. Yes. Of course I can.”</p>
