<p class="p1">“You gotta put the emphasis on the first syllable. Listen. <i>In</i>-tro-speeeecs!” He cups his hands, and his voice carries over the crowd loosely milling around one of the unknowably many entrances to Wu Ke Nai He. This little segment of it, on the southeast corner of a sprawling twelve blocks, Baidu Maps still thinks is a warehouse full of vacuum parts.</p>
<p class="p1">“No. C’mon. You sound like you’re selling hot dogs at a baseball game. In Mandarin, you gotta get a patter going. Take everything we have and string it all together, a little too fast.” Then, bringing my voice up into my nose: “Genzhe globes — Introspecs — Flower crowns — Quasi wands — Genzhe globes...” I rifle through our pushcart, layers of cheap plastic treasures pilfered from Min’s storeroom. “Christ, what else do we have in here?”</p>
<p class="p1">He gave me the stink eye. “Hey, who’s done this before?”</p>
<p class="p1">It was utterly endearing, the way he had it all ready to go when I arrived at Triple Point for the last time: the pushcart, the sorted piles of rave paraphernalia, a forged vendor’s permit to boot. Min was doing laoban shit up front, <span class="s1">wiping the counter, blowing dust off ancient clamshell casings. She shoved mooncakes into our mouths.</span> Hands on her hips, overtly skeptical, she regarded Tethi’s <span class="s1">pushcart like a long-forgotten toy.</span> “So <i>this</i> is how you’re spending the Mid-Autumn Festival? Why not just enjoy things, Teth? Why be like this?”</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s fish in a barrel, <i>Min ayi</i>. We need the money.”</p>
<p class="p1">She harrumphed. “No, good! Go, go on, take it out. <span class="s1">It’s an awful waste of space and it doesn’t sell here.</span>” Then, turning to me with a sly smile: “This is how they found him, you know. Selling this absolute junk on the streets.”</p>
<p class="p1">Something passed between them then, broadband and narrowbeam, that I wasn’t privy to. Surely she had questions about Tethi’s backpack, big enough to live out of for some indefinite future. But they kept up the charade ’til he was outside. Then he turned on his heel, just as the door chimed open, and they embraced in the warm light of the shopfront. I saw him press a hard wallet into her hand, and her return it firmly. I watched from under the concrete as he wiped away her tears, held back his own. <i>I will, I will, </i>I thought I heard him say.</p>
<p class="p1">We walked our pushcart, mostly in silence, towards the center of Triple Point. Tethi kept setting his face straight, I kept not noticing how his lips wobbled at the edges. Wu Ke Nai He was where the Chalkers first peeled him off the sidewalk: he didn’t have to tell me, and I didn’t ask. But that was the shadow of his insistence that the venue’s Mid-Autumn parties were the stuff of legend. That I’d understand once inside why this had to be the place.</p>
<p class="p1">“<i>In</i>-tro-speeeecs!”</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Oh, yeah, Introspecs: </span><span class="s3">what might be sunglasses, every edge a curve, a hi-res screen conjoining the outer lenses. The stems have very simple UTMS sensors, used to divine the wearer’s emotion and splash it in color across their eyes. They were red-hot a few years ago, and Min had accumulated hundreds of pairs. We spent a hellish, weird, wonderful week cracking open as many as we could and rewiring them into Sunflower Sieve debris detectors. Now we’re each wearing a pair, showing swirls of yellows and greens.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">The crowd thickens, the bass beckons; we sell more flower crowns than Introspecs, with downtime to spare for more mooncakes and boats of thick, spicy noodles. <i>Finally</i> a customer approaches with the giveaway hair cutouts. “A pair each for me and my girl,” he insists. He’s short with us, distracted, obviously on something. His hard wallet opens with a <i>ka-click</i> worth more than my life.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">“Two hundred for the both,” Tethi decides. Will they notice how heavy they are, crammed with radios and extra sensors? They will not. They’re listing colors to each other, running out of obvious ones, delighting in this. Tethi’s obsequious grin turns to an obscene grimace the moment he wheels away. “<i>Fuck</i>. <i>Sa mère la pute.”</i> And so on and so forth, making a slashing note on his spreadsheet, marking yet another customer as <i>not a neikonaut.</i> “We need to get in closer. We’re not making enough sales over here.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">“You’re on edge. The main act isn’t on for three hours.” But I follow him as he wheels his cart across the street, across the ward boundary. He <i>is</i> on edge. I see him daring the Chalkers who run this place to come give us a hard time, but why? Does he want a figh? A way back in? Are those just the same thing? They come upon us three to a whirlwind, inscribing tight circles around us, their black garb revealed as nothing but latex spray. A similar gloss of white on their faces, over their lips, into their nostrils, shorn even of eyelashes. They’re practically vacuum-sealed in there, for chrissakes, locked into wide-eyed grins of visceral satisfaction. Converging in front of us and asking with terrifying, matte-black blinks, <i>what gives?</i> Tethi meets their contortions with his own, and when the Chalkers drift away, I realize he hasn’t blinked for a full minute.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">“So we can stay here?” I whisper, duly impressed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">He wrinkles his nose, just because he can. “Until the next ones come by.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">We manage to get the other fourteen pairs onto the faces of neikonauts. The other junk sells slowly, overlooked for oversized sunflowers offered by other pushcarts. We offload our wares to them for a song.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">Behind piles of corrugated rust we transform into patrons of Wu Ke Nai He. We peek, delighted, at the rollscroll: all but one of the readouts light up with Sieve debris. Still uncorrelated. It gets unrolled and taped inside Tethi’s jacket; the RF receiver gets taped far enough up my leg to justify a slap. When he’s not looking, I also tape an autovial there; hey, it’s a club.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">For two hours, we’ve watched the capillaries of the metro deposit thousands of people in line before us. It folds into switchbacks, sprouts tributaries. Veetles impending with deadly heat from above have nowhere to land. “We could just stay outside,” I offer, snapping my gum discontentedly. “They won’t go out of range.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">He gives me a look: <i>you don’t mean that and you know it.</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">The line spills into Luxing Ward, whose redlights are nineteen and pimple-faced and undersized for their mall-cop getups. Their glo-wand waving has zero effect on the flow of traffic. They snarl at Wu Ke’s Chalkers, who gaze placidly back. Then they call the real cops. A hefty Blue Delta veetle finds purchase. Bluelights spill out, unhappy to be here, channeling rump authority with more glo-wands. More Chalkers, too. In their acute glances, clockweb and spiderwork, something spectral rears its head at a hundred twenty bpm.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">All the while dying to check Tethi’s rollscroll.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">(A reveler breaks out of line. To whoops and cheers, she tries directing traffic with glo-wands we sold her.)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">All the while imagining explaining this to Deng. <i>It’s a rave, but you wouldn’t call it that, you’d call it a “party”...</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">Entry is by way of double velvet curtains, operated airlock-style by ghostly white hands. Immediately, bass subsumes all. Teth and I get one last glance, and then we’re split, by a black velvet wedge, into two security lines. The attendant patting me takes the autovial for granted, and completely misses the RF receiver. “Your gum,” he drones, gesturing hand-it-over.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">“My <i>gum</i>? For real?” Suddenly I’m prepared to blow the whole operation over half a pack of Mint San Wei.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">“We’re the Weather Bureau,” his buddy insists. He has knifepoint sigil-scars wreathing his eyes and a lollipop in his cheek. “And the Bureau needs your gum.” With an orange-stained smirk he counts out three sticks for each of them, and hands me two back. But I’m in. All hints of geometry or scale are subsumed by matte black. Hesitant, diagonal steps, cutting sideways through the pressure, until I round another velvet wall.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">On the other side are the Ripples.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">They rise in soft, vague columns of quasigraphic light. They slicker rectilinearly along silkscreen mazes. No scarce and wispy tendrils, either. These are prime cuts, enough geometry to make sense of a Ripple as a whole. Cheetah-space phase-field rings, chains of polygon shatter, peeling and selfsame cactus-blooms: adequate description of these patterns would come with a strobe warning, but <i>bright</i> white, colorbled at the fringes. And on beat with the music, with shatters of its echoes, fed by directly by steel columns of silver teardrops, infrared rings the color of nothing, packing the ceiling, packing the walls, blooming from table centerpieces. Watching us how we move to the beat, how the Ripples move in response, closing the loop from camera to screen to camera, feedback loops riding the ceiling, teasing the exponential. A loose, juicy wave passes behind my eyes and suddenly I have no head. Queasy, almost ill. I can’t find myself in the crowd. I only need eyes to see that <i>here</i> is <i>there</i>, I don’t even have to pretend...</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">“Mona!” Tethi’s voice narrows it way down. His hand finds an arm, leads its owner off the ground and around a circular velvet outcrop. I swear it takes a revolution and a half to get to the bathrooms. He leans me <i>(oh — me)</i> against a wall. “Are you going to be all right in here?”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">“I just didn’t...” says something called Mona, a lost love, a favorite flavor. “It’s a bit more than I expected.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">“Yeah. That’s what people say.” Sympathy from a distance. For Tethi, this place is a crude condensation, even a parody, of a deeper and more fulsome relationship with the Ripples. But Wu Ke earns its sheen of danger. People hear <i>it’s where the Ripples bring us to dance</i>, and realize it’s true. The quadratically inclined disappear the same night.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">Soon we have the rollscroll out on a hi-top, brightness down, sipping uppers and lime. Our mesh network of headsets, all triangulating each others’ locations, has already thinned into the crowd. We strobe them in bright white and catch only one pair, a room over. Thumping correlations appear in of our unwitting test subjects’ debris: that’s the music, but it’s the beginning of something. Our software glues it all together into great scaffolds like the ones we see in the Sea. It’s speculation. It’s a little overfitted. And the sensors in the Introspecs are incredibly lo-res. Hardly definitive proof of mass transference. But if we can bring it back to the Observatory, and they find an equivalent structure...</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">“Yo,” Tethi whispers. We’ve been getting glances, and he sounds real on edge. “Number seven.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">The debris from that headset seven looks very weak. Maybe the battery is —</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">“Oh. <i>Oh.</i> She wasn’t a neikonaut!”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">“Maybe she traded with her boyfriend.” But he sounds unconvinced. “Maybe they...what are you doing?”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">I’m holding the rollscroll up to my face. I’m trying to see the raw data, fifteen raggedly pixelated readouts, with fresh eyes. I focus on number seven, where spiral-comb-claw shapes bob just above the noise floor. If Sunflower Sieve debris is capable of sliding into the minds of non-neikonauts, even just a little, that changes the parameters of the entire experiment. I don’t have time to reprogram it now. I focus just past it...</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">And then I know where in the Mirror Sea we are.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">“We need to get in there.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">Whatever Tethi sees in the readouts stops his protest in his throat. “Where, exactly?”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">I draw a big circle on our rough map of the club, and stow the rollscroll. “Towards number seven.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">The thick of the crowd gives me a choice: tendrils or elbows. I can just look <i>up</i> at the Ripples and lose myself completely. That’s what everyone’s here to do: Chalker, chaser, neikonaut. Flower crowns, quasi-wands, LED-glow sunflowers raised in saucer-eyed ecstasy. Or I can keep my eyes below meridian, focus on human bodies, on arms and butts and pheromones, looking at <i>you </i>and <i>you </i>and <i>you</i> and <i>sorry, excuse me</i>, pushing through a great collective trance, seeing the wave for its particles. It becomes apparent that there are so many goddamn rooms in this place. Warehouse-sized, closet-sized, the music interpolates seamlessly between all of them. The Ripples move far more easily than we do. I measure out a glance. Some are vast and polycentric, lurking in the saddle-points of the backscreens, feeding via interference. But the ones up close jelly-pulse, whip-chatter, spiral-bounce. They brush past each other so fluidly, so harmlessly, that it’s easy to believe that they’re leading the dance.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">Three rooms in, four, five. I’ve acquired and overcome claustrophobia. Still sliding by sideways intuition, I clench my fist hard, and my wanji sends a wave of DMT into my leg. Instantly the characteristic E-flat buzz of the come-up, waves of sickly yellow and green flashing before my eyes, a sudden and elaborate gnosis. It bounces through my neikotic channels, and my eyes prickle with a staticky wall crawling with those sticky little tile-cules of Sieve debris. And then...</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">I’ve been chasing something huge and round and gold at the fringes of my awareness. I expected the DMT to bring a clearer vision of the hundred-tendril sunflower orb at the center of the Ripples’ city.. Instead, I see — and smell — sunflowers. A whole field of them, the size of dinner plates. Five to each high, haughty stalk. And among them, some distance away, a <i>face, </i>looking just as ghostly and startled as I must just now<i>.</i> Through thick confusion I try raising my voice to flag her down. I take a tentative step forward and feel my bare feet in the dirt...</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3"><i>“What?”</i> Tethi shouts in my ear, bringing me back to earth. <i>“Which way now?”</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">I point in the direction I just saw Dr. Deng go.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">There’s no elbow room for a rollscroll, but I don’t care what the damn chi-squared tests say. This is the right way, it has to be, because the displays around us are filling up with thick, lithic, grooving shapes. Hyperlagmites of all kinds, not just of Sieve debris. We’re here, right at the rough-hewn edges of their city...</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">I apologize my way inwards, here to flailing shoulder and now to a wide, green leaf. I hear a shout of protest and turn to see the wide, black face of a sunflower blinking at me, beady seedy eyes each one unseeing but their sum total uncomfortably like the gaze that oh, after all, is from the holder of the beverage I just spilled with a stray swipe…</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">At this I begin to lose track of the where and when of things. The simple <i>whump-whump-whump</i> of the bassline yields to a syncopation of clicks and whines, which crescendo and flatten into a sustained and ominous drone. I clench my fist again: waves of tryptamine interfere, add and subtract but mostly add, layering into purples and purples and <i>so many purples</i>, but also reds and the deepest, richest browns, like the loam underfoot.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3"><i>“Mona!”</i> Tethi shouts from five paces. I can’t read his expression at all, there’s too much else to see, the twinkling city of hyperlagmites, its twisting Ripples, just behind a murky crystalline wall. I’m <i>just</i> outside it, I just need to take that last step. And for several seconds of silence I take in the scene around me like a landscape, fanning lasers passing lazy through distant clouds, thrumming beat rising and falling off the membranes of a million insects. I read one last thing off Tethi’s lips: “<i>she’s over there!” </i>And then I inch forward, willing myself into their world. With the sudden sureness of bird on windowpane I’m not here, I’m there among the sunflowers. And now <i>that’s</i> here, and I’m not <i>there </i>anymore.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">And where was that anyway?</span></p>
