<p class="p1">“You gotta put the emphasis on the first syllable. Listen. <i>In</i>-tro-speeeecs!” He cups his hands, and his voice carries over the crowd loosely milling around one of the unknowably many entrances to Wu Ke Nai He. This little segment of it, on the northeast of a sprawling twelve blocks, Baidu Maps still thinks is a warehouse full of vacuum parts.</p>
<p class="p1">“No. C’mon. You sound like you’re selling hot dogs at a baseball game. In Mandarin, you gotta get a patter going. Take everything we have and string it all together, a little too fast.” Then, bringing my voice up into my nose: “Genzhe globes — Introspecs — Flower crowns — Quasi wands — Genzhe globes...” I rifle through our pushcart, layers of cheap plastic treasures pilfered from Min’s storeroom. “Christ, what else do we have in here?”</p>
<p class="p1">He gave me the stink eye. “Hey, who’s done this before?”</p>
<p class="p1">It was utterly endearing, the way he had it all ready to go when I arrived at Triple Point for the last time: the pushcart, the sorted piles of rave paraphernalia, a forged vendor’s permit to boot. Min was doing laoban shit up front, <span class="s1">wiping the counter, blowing dust off ancient clamshell casings. She shoved mooncakes into our mouths.</span> Hands on her hips, overtly skeptical, she regarded Tethi’s <span class="s1">pushcart like a long-forgotten toy.</span> “So <i>this</i> is how you’re spending the Mid-Autumn Festival? Why not just enjoy things, Teth? Why be like this?”</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s fish in a barrel, <i>Min ayi</i>. We need the money.”</p>
<p class="p1">She harrumphed. “No, good! Go, go on, take it out. <span class="s1">It’s an awful waste of space and it doesn’t sell here.</span>” Then, turning to me with a sly smile: “This is how they found him, you know. Selling this absolute junk on the streets.”</p>
<p class="p1">Something passed between them then, broadband and narrowbeam, that I wasn’t privy to. Surely she had questions about Tethi’s backpack, big enough to live out of for some indefinite future. But they kept up the charade ’til he was outside. Then he turned on his heel, just as the door chimed open, and they embraced in the warm light of the shopfront. I saw him press a hard wallet into her hand, and her return it firmly. I watched from under the concrete as he wiped away her tears, held back his own. <i>I will, I will, </i>I thought I heard him say.</p>
<p class="p1">We walked our pushcart, mostly in silence, towards the center of Triple Point. Tethi kept setting his face straight, I kept not noticing how his lips wobbled at the edges. Wu Ke Nai He was where the Chalkers first peeled him off the sidewalk: he didn’t have to tell me, and I didn’t ask. But that was the shadow of his insistence that the venue’s Mid-Autumn parties were the stuff of legend. That I’d understand once inside why this had to be the place.</p>
<p class="p1">“<i>In</i>-tro-speeeecs!”</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Oh, yeah, Introspecs: </span><span class="s3">what might be sunglasses, every edge a curve, a hi-res screen conjoining the outer lenses. The stems have very simple UTMS sensors, used to divine the wearer’s emotion and splash it in color across their eyes. They were red-hot a few years ago, and Min had accumulated hundreds of pairs. We spent a hellish, weird, wonderful week cracking open as many as we could and rewiring them into Sunflower Sieve debris detectors. Now we’re each wearing a pair, showing swirls of yellows and greens, shouting our voices hoarse to be heard.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">The crowd thickens, the bass beckons, but it’s clear by how well-lit this corner is that we’ve set up too from the venue. Genzhe globes in luminous red and lunar gold and bob just overhead, halfheartedly chasing their owners through a ramble of midair calligraphy and quasigraphic rabbit hunts and mournfully melodic diziphone showdowns. We sell more flower crowns than Introspecs, with plenty of downtime for boats of thick, spicy noodles and another round of mooncakes. The Fudan Ripple-dance team appears beneath an enormous sheet: undulating down the lane with elsewhere’s choreography, raking in tips via QR codes flashed along their shared surface between acts. Afterwards, two of them approach us for Introspecs. Tethi hesitates — we need to be selling these to neikonauts — but he relents when one of them opens a hard wallet with a <i>ka-click </i>worth more than my life.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">“Four hundred for the both,” he decides. And will they notice how heavy they are, crammed with radios and extra sensors? They will not. They’re clearly on something. Listing colors to each other, running out of obvious ones, delighting in this. Tethi’s obsequious grin turns to an obscene grimace the moment he wheels away. “<i>Fuck</i>. <i>Sa mère la pute.”</i> And so on and so forth, making a slashing note on his spreadsheet, marking even more customers as <i>not a neikonaut.</i> “We need to get in closer. This is the wrong crowd to be selling to here.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">“You’re on edge. The main act isn’t on for like three hours.” But I don’t protest as he wheels the cart up the lane until we cross the chain-link fence, where our wares glow in a deeper dark. Tethi <i>is</i> on edge. I sense him daring the Chalkers who run this place to come give us a hard time, but why? Does he want a fight? A way back in? Are those just the same thing? They come upon us three to a whirlwind, inscribing tight circles around us, their black garb revealed as nothing but latex spray. A similar gloss of white on their faces, over their lips, into their nostrils, shorn even of eyelashes. They’re practically vacuum-sealed in there, for chrissakes, locked into wide-eyed grins of visceral satisfaction. Converging in front of us and asking with terrifying, matte-black blinks, <i>what gives?</i> Tethi meets their contortions with his own, and when the Chalkers drift away, I realize he hasn’t blinked for a full minute.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">“So we can stay here?” I whisper, duly impressed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">He wrinkles his nose, glad that he can. “Until the next ones come by.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">We manage to get many of the Introspecs onto the faces of neikonauts. The other junk sells slowly, overlooked for the oversized, glowing sunflowers offered by other pushcarts. We offload our wares to them for a song.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">Behind piles of corrugated rust we transform into patrons of Wu Ke Nai He. We peek, delighted, at the rollscroll, at the readouts lighting up with Sieve debris. This gets unrolled and taped inside Tethi’s jacket; the RF receiver gets taped far enough up my leg to justify a slap. When he’s not looking, I also tape an autovial there; hey, it’s a club.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">For hours, we’ve watched the capillaries of the metro deposit thousands of people in line before us. It folds into switchbacks, sprouts tributaries. Veetles impending with deadly heat from above have nowhere to land. “We could just stay outside,” I offer, snapping my gum discontentedly. “They won’t go out of range.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">He gives me a look: <i>you don’t mean that and you know it.</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">The line spills into neighboring Luxing Ward, whose redlights are nineteen and pimple-faced and undersized for their mall-cop getups. Their glo-wand waving has zero effect on the flow of traffic. They snarl at Wu Ke’s Chalkers, who gaze placidly back. Then they call the real cops. A hefty Blue Delta veetle finds purchase. Bluelights spill out, unhappy to be here, channeling rump authority with more glo-wands. More Chalkers, too. In their acute glances, clockweb and spiderwork, something spectral rears its head at a hundred twenty bpm.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">All the while dying to check Tethi’s rollscroll again.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">A reveler breaks out of line. To whoops and cheers, she tries directing traffic with glo-wands we sold her.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">All the while imagining how to relay this to Deng. <i>It’s a rave, but you wouldn’t call it that, you’d call it a “party”...</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">Entry is by way of double velvet curtains, operated airlock-style by ghostly white hands. Immediately, bass subsumes all. Teth and I get one last glance, and then we’re split, by a black velvet wedge, into two security lines. The attendant patting me takes the autovial for granted, and completely misses the RF receiver. “Your gum,” he drones, gesturing hand-it-over.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">“My <i>gum</i>? For real?” Suddenly I’m prepared to blow the whole operation over half a pack of Mint San Wei.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">“We’re the Weather Bureau,” his buddy insists. He has knifepoint sigil-scars wreathing his eyes and a lollipop in his cheek. “And the Bureau needs your gum.” With a cherry-stained smirk he counts out three sticks for each of them, and hands me two back. But I’m in. All hints of geometry or scale are subsumed by matte black. Hesitant, diagonal steps, cutting sideways through the pressure, until I round another velvet wall.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">On the other side are the Ripples.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">They rise in soft, vague columns of quasigraphic light. They slicker rectilinearly along silkscreen mazes, lurking in foggy saddle-points, feeding via interference. No scarce and wispy tendrils, either. These are prime cuts, enough geometry to make sense of a Ripple as a whole. Cheetah-space phase-field rings, chains of polygon shatter, peeling and selfsame cactus-blooms: adequate description of these patterns would come with a strobe warning, but <i>bright</i> white, colorbled at the fringes. And on beat with the music, with its smeared echoes, fed by directly by steel columns of silver teardrops, infrared rings the color of nothing, packing the ceiling, packing the walls, blooming from table centerpieces. We move to the beat and the Ripples move in response, closing the loop from camera to screen to camera, feedback loops riding the ceiling, teasing the exponential. A loose, juicy wave passes behind my eyes and suddenly I’m lost, profoundly lost, in the crowd. My vision goes wide — I only need eyes to see that <i>here</i> is <i>there</i>, I don’t even have to pretend...</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">“Mona!” Tethi’s voice narrows it way down. His hand finds an arm, leads its owner off the ground and around a circular velvet outcrop. I swear it takes a revolution and a half to get to the bathrooms. He leans me <i>(oh — me)</i> against a wall. “Are you going to be all right in here?”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">“I just didn’t...” says something called Mona, a lost love, a favorite flavor. “It’s a bit more than I expected.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">“Yeah. That’s what people say.” Sympathy from a distance. For Tethi, this place is a crude condensation, even a parody, of a deeper and more fulsome relationship with the Ripples. But Wu Ke earns its sheen of danger. People hear <i>it’s where the Ripples bring us to dance</i>, and realize it’s true. The quadratically inclined disappear the same night.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">We flatten the rollscroll on a high-top, brightness down, sipping uppers and lime. Our mesh network of headsets, all triangulating each others’ locations, has long since thinned into the crowd. The music feeds thumping correlations in their debris. The readouts are choppy things, sixteen pixels to a side, but another layer of software weaves them together into something like Yao’s model. If it’s right — if any of this is real — then this is the Ripples’ sunflower structure we’ve found in their minds. And we are very, very near the center.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">“Yo,” Tethi whispers. We’ve been getting glances, and he sounds even more on edge now. “Numbers eighteen and nineteen.” And the debris from those headsets looks very weak. Maybe the batteries are —</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">“Oh. <i>Oh.</i> They were the Ripple-dancers. Depths below, Tethi, <i>those weren’t neikonauts!</i>”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">We sold dozens of headsets to people without neikotic channels. We wrote them off as a bust. But now I flip through the readouts — if all of these people, regular people, are carrying traces of Sieve debris —</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">“It’s spreading.” Tethi gives me a weird look, a dangerous and darkly triumphant look.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3"><i>“You saw this coming!”</i> Unsure whether this merits a slap or a high five. “You did!”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">“I considered it a possibility. It — would have been unwise to bring it up.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">Because he didn’t want to speak it into existence. <i>Because</i> — the parabola has more to say, it always does — <i>because you caused this, Mona, you just can’t stop looking, can’t stop believing, can you?</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">“We need to get in there,” I tell him. I wait for some objection, but now Tethi is entranced the quasigrams overhead. The Ripples are on the move. They jelly-pulse, whip-chatter, spiral-bounce; whatever they do, it’s all in the same direction. They wriggle and jostle, passing through their fellows in white-hot bursts, practically annihilating each other in a feverish race inwards. Tethi slams his drink and returns the rollscroll to his jacket.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">“I think we should follow them.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">The thick of the crowd gives me a choice: tendrils or elbows. I can look up at the Ripples and lose myself completely. That’s what everyone’s here to do: Chalker, chaser, neikonaut. Flower crowns, quasi-wands, LED-glow sunflowers raised in saucer-eyed ecstasy. Or I can keep my eyes below meridian, focus on human bodies, on arms and butts and pheromones, looking at <i>you </i>and <i>you </i>and <i>you</i> and <i>sorry, excuse me</i>, pushing through a great collective trance, seeing the wave for its particles. It becomes apparent that there are so many goddamn rooms in this place. Warehouse-sized, closet-sized, the music interpolates seamlessly between all of them. The thronging Ripples move smoothly by comparison, making it easy to believe they’re leading the dance.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3"><i>One hit.</i> Just to get our bearings. I clench my fist hard, and the autovial sends a wave of DMT into my leg. Instantly the E-flat buzz of the come-up, waves of sickly yellow and green flashing before my eyes, a sudden and elaborate gnosis. It bounces through my neikotic channels, coating them with sticky, staticky little tile-cules of Sieve debris. For the length of a terrible spasm, I have hundreds of limbs, thousands of fingers, my whole being a cartography of the Ripples’ designs on the Sea. I point, and mouth the words, but it’s so loud don’t even bother to shout: <i>This way!</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">I turn around to find Tethi. Instead I see Dr. Deng Jinghan, arms crossed, taut ponytail whipping in the wind, standing tall and proud in a field of sunflowers.</span></p>
