<p class="p1">“You gotta put the emphasis on the first syllable. Listen. <i>In</i>-tro-speeeecs!” He cups his hands, and his voice carries over the crowd loosely milling around one of the unknowably many entrances to Wu Ke Nai He. This little segment of it, on the northeast of a sprawling twelve blocks, Baidu Maps still thinks is a warehouse full of vacuum parts.</p>
<p class="p1">“No. C’mon. You sound like you’re selling hot dogs at a baseball game. In Mandarin, you gotta get a patter going. Take everything we have and string it all together, a little too fast.” Then, bringing my voice up into my nose: “Genzhe globes — Introspecs — Flower crowns — Quasi wands — Genzhe globes...” I rifle through our pushcart, layers of cheap plastic treasures pilfered from Min’s storeroom. “Christ, what else do we have in here?”</p>
<p class="p1">He gives me the stink eye. “Hey, who’s done this before?”</p>
<p class="p1">It was utterly endearing, the way he had it all ready to go when I arrived at Triple Point for the last time: the pushcart, the sorted piles of rave paraphernalia, a forged vendor’s permit to boot. Min was doing laoban shit up front, <span class="s1">wiping the counter, blowing dust off ancient clamshell casings. She shoved mooncakes into our mouths.</span> Hands on her hips, overtly skeptical, she regarded Tethi’s <span class="s1">pushcart like a long-forgotten toy.</span> “So <i>this</i> is how you’re spending the Mid-Autumn Festival? Why not just enjoy things, Teth? Why be like this?”</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s fish in a barrel, <i>Min ayi</i>. We need the money.”</p>
<p class="p1">She harrumphed. “No, good! Go, go on, take it out. <span class="s1">It’s an awful waste of space and it doesn’t sell here.</span>” Then, turning to me with a sly smile: “This is how they found him, you know. Selling this absolute junk on the streets.”</p>
<p class="p1">Something passed between them then, broadband and narrowbeam, that I wasn’t privy to. Surely she had questions about Tethi’s backpack, big enough to live out of for some indefinite future. But they kept up the charade ’til he was outside. Then he turned on his heel, just as the door chimed open, and they embraced in the warm light of the shopfront. I saw him press a hard wallet into her hand, and her return it firmly. I watched from under the concrete as he wiped away her tears, held back his own. <i>I will, I will, </i>I thought I heard him say.</p>
<p class="p1">We walked our pushcart, mostly in silence, towards the center of Triple Point. Tethi kept setting his face straight, I kept not noticing how his lips wobbled at the edges. Wu Ke Nai He was where the Chalkers first peeled him off the sidewalk: he didn’t have to tell me, and I didn’t ask. But that was the shadow of his insistence that the venue’s Mid-Autumn parties were the stuff of legend. That I’d understand once inside why this had to be the place.</p>
<p class="p1">“<i>In</i>-tro-speeeecs!”</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Oh, yeah, Introspecs: </span><span class="s3">what might be sunglasses, every edge a curve, a hi-res screen conjoining the outer lenses. The stems have very simple UTMS sensors, used to divine the wearer’s emotion and splash it in color across their eyes. They were red-hot a few years ago, and Min had accumulated hundreds of pairs. We spent a hellish, weird, wonderful week cracking open as many as we could and rewiring them into Sunflower Sieve debris detectors. Now we’re each wearing a pair, showing swirls of yellows and greens, shouting our voices hoarse to be heard.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">The crowd thickens, the bass beckons, but it’s clear by how well-lit this corner is that we’ve set up too from the venue. Genzhe globes in luminous red and lunar gold and bob just overhead, halfheartedly chasing their owners through a ramble of midair calligraphy and quasigraphic rabbit hunts and mournfully melodic diziphone showdowns. We sell more flower crowns than Introspecs, with plenty of downtime for boats of thick, spicy noodles and another round of mooncakes. Fudan University’s Ripple-dance team appears beneath an enormous sheet: undulating down the lane with elsewhere’s choreography, raking in tips via QR codes flashed along their shared surface between acts. Afterwards, two of them approach us for Introspecs. Tethi hesitates — we need to be selling these to neikonauts — but he relents when one of them opens a hard wallet with a <i>ka-click </i>worth more than my life.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">“Four hundred for the both,” he decides. And will they notice how heavy they are, crammed with radios and extra sensors? They will not. They’re clearly on something. Listing colors to each other, running out of obvious ones, delighting in this. Tethi’s obsequious grin turns to an obscene grimace the moment he wheels away. “<i>Fuck</i>. <i>Sa mère la pute.”</i> And so on and so forth, making a slashing note on his spreadsheet, marking even more customers as <i>not a neikonaut.</i> “We need to get in closer. This is the wrong crowd to be selling to here.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">“You’re on edge. The main act isn’t on for like three hours.” But I don’t protest as he wheels the cart up the lane until we cross the chain-link fence, where our wares glow in a deeper dark. Tethi <i>is</i> on edge. I sense him daring the Chalkers who run this place to come give us a hard time, but why? Does he want a fight? A way back in? Are those just the same thing? They come upon us three to a whirlwind, inscribing tight circles around us, their black garb revealed as nothing but latex spray. A similar gloss of white on their faces, over their lips, into their nostrils, shorn even of eyelashes. They’re practically vacuum-sealed in there, for chrissakes, locked into wide-eyed grins of visceral satisfaction. Converging in front of us and asking with terrifying, matte-black blinks, <i>what gives?</i> Tethi meets their contortions with his own, and when the Chalkers drift away, I realize he hasn’t blinked for a full minute.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">“So we can stay here?” I whisper, duly impressed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">He wrinkles his nose, glad that he can. “Until the next ones come by.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">We manage to get many of the Introspecs onto the faces of neikonauts. The other junk sells slowly, overlooked for the oversized, glowing sunflowers offered by other pushcarts. We offload our wares to them for a song.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">Behind piles of corrugated rust we transform into patrons of Wu Ke Nai He. We peek, delighted, at the rollscroll, at the readouts lighting up with Sieve debris. This gets unrolled and taped inside Tethi’s jacket; the RF receiver gets taped far enough up my leg to justify a slap. When he’s not looking, I also tape an autovial there; hey, it’s a club.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">For hours, we’ve watched the capillaries of the metro deposit thousands of people in line before us. It folds into switchbacks, sprouts tributaries. Veetles impending with deadly heat from above have nowhere to land. “We could just stay outside,” I offer, snapping my gum discontentedly. “They won’t go out of range.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">He gives me a look: <i>you don’t mean that and you know it.</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">The line spills into neighboring Luxing Ward, whose redlights are nineteen and pimple-faced and undersized for their mall-cop getups. Their glo-wand waving has zero effect on the flow of traffic. They snarl at Wu Ke’s Chalkers, who gaze placidly back. Then they call the real cops. A hefty Blue Delta veetle finds purchase. Bluelights spill out, unhappy to be here, channeling rump authority with more glo-wands. More Chalkers, too. In their acute glances, clockweb and spiderwork, something spectral rears its head at a hundred twenty bpm.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">All the while dying to check Tethi’s rollscroll again.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">A reveler breaks out of line. To whoops and cheers, she tries directing traffic with glo-wands we sold her.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">All the while imagining how to relay this to Deng. <i>It’s a rave, but you wouldn’t call it that, you’d call it a “party”...</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">Entry is by way of double velvet curtains, operated airlock-style by ghostly white hands. Immediately, bass subsumes all. Teth and I get one last glance, and then we’re split, by a black velvet wedge, into two security lines. The attendant patting me takes the autovial for granted, and completely misses the RF receiver. “Your gum,” he drones, gesturing hand-it-over.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">“My <i>gum</i>? For real?” Suddenly I’m prepared to blow the whole operation over half a pack of Mint San Wei.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">“We’re the Weather Bureau,” his buddy insists. He has knifepoint sigil-scars wreathing his eyes and a lollipop in his cheek. “And the Bureau needs your gum.” With a cherry-stained smirk he counts out three sticks for each of them, and hands me two back. But I’m in. All hints of geometry or scale are subsumed by matte black. Hesitant, diagonal steps, cutting sideways through the pressure, until I round another velvet wall.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">On the other side are the Ripples.</span></p>
