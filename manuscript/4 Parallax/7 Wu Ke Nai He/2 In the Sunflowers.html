<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The heat must be getting to me. How many hours have I been chasing the sun through these wildflowers? It’s absurd enough that this was my plan, more absurd still that for a long time, it appeared to work. What kind of stars, what kind of moon, will be here to light my path when my legs finally falter and the sun sets? It’s a risk I can’t afford to take, so I’ve been trudging steadily west, jogging in bursts, and keeping that sun above me. If that’s what it really is. I hear it throwing off low rumbles and wind chime harmonics, and I find I can stare at it without pain, even strain my eyes to unpack its bright white into fine swirls of gold. But whenever I look back up, it seems to have moved much further west, so for now I keep it in the corner of my mind.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Instead I focus on the sunflowers and, in their own way, they focus on me. Each has at its center a thousand tiny onyx eyelets which form a large compound eye, with such hazy perception that you may stand in front of one for the span of ten breaths and make no more than the slightest smudge on its world. But plant them together and their roots tangle and intersect, sharing and elaborating on the same great image until they not only see you, but seem to anticipate you. I crane my neck backwards now: in the uncountable miles of them, rising and falling on shallow hills, I can make out the gentlest trace of my presence. They have turned, too subtly to notice in the moment, to face me as I pass. Spend all day in the sunflowers and you begin to exist solely on their terms, your soul knit from grass and dew coursing through your veins, no trouble swifter than a hungry caterpillar even in the spectrum of your attention.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And spend too long away from the flowers, well, I shudder to think. I might buy a few minutes on the glance of a blackbird hanging off a reed, or by grinding my feet into the dirt to cave in an anthill, but the fabric of causality is ever-mending and ever-spooling into unseen depths. To be stitched out takes far less than I once thought: a few minutes in unobserved stillness will do it. I could rise from my reverie and find that the universe has simply moved on without me, along a simpler course through time that carries no trace of my past and leaves me no way back into the future. That such a thing has never been observed in missing socks, in hibernating raccoons, in elderly neighbors, is less than cold comfort — it is precisely the point. The truest terror is just out of our peripheral vision, on the lip of a maw too wide to see through our telescopes. Death is a smokescreen. We are right to fear it, but as the proximate cause of <i>this</i>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And the sun is lower in the sky now, and the sunflowers can’t see in the dark.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But I need a break, even under this reddening sky. Time passes so strangely here that my exhausted stumbling towards the stream, collapsing on the ground, and drinking my fill, are stretched into the same rubber-band present, finally snapping loose as I dunk my head underwater for the third or fourth time. <i>You’re going to die here, Mona</i>. <i>You’re going to go unseen and slip away.</i> Already I feel the creep of other possibilities that neatly fill my little vacuum in spacetime. I see it now in the widening bell curve of faces shimmering back on the surface of the stream, my close bob lengthening and my narrow face filling out. {{Mona Xu,}} I say out loud, trying to remember what it’s worth. No one is around to care.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Only...there is someone.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">{{You’re not her,}} comes a high, crisp voice behind me. A whirlwind reorientation, a twanging oscillation that sets my back foot in the stream. When I find myself again in the space between self and other, I’m butt down in the mud, and there’s a face looking up — <i>wait, no, focus, Mona</i> — down at me. A face shimmering between features, but all centered on — <i>am I doing this, or is she? </i>— centered around something familiar. She offers no hand up. If she offers any reaction at all to my fall, it’s in the upper harmonics of her sneer. I scramble to my feet, and find something that passes for a voice.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">{{Dr. Deng?}}</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">{{You’re not her,}} the Deng-thing repeats. Its tone level and assessing, stony gaze cutting clear through. And I say <i>Deng-thing</i> because it can’t be her, it just can’t, not even with that signature sigh of disappointment. Not even because she looks unstuck in time, betraying no particular age between ten years my senior or forty centuries old. She — it — steps forward and takes me by the chin with a cool, indifferent left hand. Inspects me at what feels like a molecular level. {{Ah — but you know her, don’t you? Didn’t I come damn close?}}</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Frozen, remembering to move, so the sunflowers will see me. They turn to face the Deng-thing — but no, that’s not quite right. The seconds drip viscously by, and I glimpse inverted causality. She follows the flowers. They project her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">{{Show her what I show you,}} the thing hisses. Then it slinks away, on foot or not, into the stalks.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Night falls in a blink. I try to follow, cursing precious minutes lost, any hydration gained now quickly sweat out. The sun falls to the horizon and disappears, revealing a compelling swirl of stars-that-are-not. I follow a surefire gradient, a path only I would take, ripping the indifferent flowers from their stalks, reveling sickly in the idea that wanton destruction might mark me as human until sunrise. <i>{{Mona Xu, Mona Xu,}}</i> I keep muttering, but it’s a lie, a waste of breath. {{<i>I am human I am here and what would a human being do, what could I do now that a scarecrow or the wind couldn’t</i>.}} It’s no use. As the last light disappears over the horizon, the sunflowers begin to close. Unobserved, I feel myself slipping away into the breeze. My existence rests on the tensile strength of quantum foam.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am nowhere, I am everywhere, in this infinite, idealized night. I am wind over the heads of the flowers and the dirt that feeds their roots. A null assertion of self, free of identity or desire, the color of nothing. Even that nullity competes with others, other non-faces stalking the flowers unseen — dozens of them, maybe...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">{{She’s just trying to help,}} comes a swirl around me. Not with recognition, but with a sweet, ambient puff of acknowledgement. Another face briefly seen from down in the dirt, inviting me to conjure a name. <i>Min? Is that Min?</i> But the Min-thing floats away, only ever a thin smile and a whisper: {{The next time you see her, be kind.}}</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Utter absence forever. I am formless. And yet still, impossibly, I am here.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And then the sun begins to rise in the east.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The sunflowers are all wrong. I only ever notice myself through their lazy gaze. And that is a shattered thing now, the root system torn to shards. I see myself peeled off the ground, throat parched, back throbbing. But the unity of the image cannot hold. I move as a multitude, a scattered stumbling in all directions, as though between shards broken and tarnished glass. I feel pushed back by the boundaries of the root systems, struggling to push myself between them, trapped in isolated little knots, lurching forward in what is revealed as an endless loop. I reach for other-Monas and they reach out in reflected turn, but nothing can bridge the gaps between the patches of sunflowers, all seeing me from disconcerted, disconnected angles. I am a shattered thing...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">{{Do you see what we deal with?}} The Deng-thing is all around me, its cruel features smeared across sun-kissed islands of sight. Even the breeze through the sunflowers is all wrong, discontinuous eddies and swirls. {{Do you see what her cowardice did? Do you see what she left me to fix?}}</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It tilts its many chins back towards the sun — which is not a sun. No sun would have such staggering, paralyzing patters running across its surface. No sun could compel the flowers to reach for me now with their clawing, beady, gnarled sightlines, isolating me, gagging me, holding me in place...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>You’re the one holding on. Let go.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The mantra comes as a dazzling, purple-and-white flash of inversion, a tunnel of concentric rings, a release. And now I’m back on the dance floor, staggering forward, causing a bit of a scene. But the attention of Wu Ke Nai He — <i>that</i> comes back to me with a clench — that attention is divided. The mechanized roof of the warehouse is humming, opening itself to the early morning Shanghai sky — <i>Shanghai </i>— to reveal...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Teth, the <i>moon</i>,” I whisper stupidly, still reaching for the sky. I find him trying to keep me upright. The harvest moon crests the open rooftops to general awe and delight, to a field of index fingers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“It’s so round!”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“So golden!”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But not everyone is pointing at the moon. In the soft light of the quasigraphic pillars, something else, rounder and more golden still, is rising into sight, surfacing on a bed of hyperlagmites. Its utter stillness belies the way it grasps for attention, utterly demands it from the crowd. In the gleaming confluence of places to look, the confusion of where to point and why, I am almost pulled back into the sunflowers. I can smell them again...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We have to go.” Tethi is tugging my arm. He is not interested in the moon, or even in the Ripples’ massive sunflower machine in the center of the center, made visible at last. His face is set with fear. <i>“Now.”</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And we plunge into the crowd, right through the knot of Chalkers closing in on us. One of them aims a vialgun and fires; the slug bruises my leg and stays there and already I feel drowsy, newly confused, but all I have to do is follow Tethi. He waves the rollscroll like a club, bopping the confused and tripping masses who make way not for us but for the Chalker tailing us, their glossy faces expressionless. The whirl of another vialgun, another bruising punch to my back. The slug hits the zipper of my dress but a few of its teeth puncture through to my skin and I feel tired, so tired. Through an impinging haze I watch Tethi rip a red amphetamine autovial off the arm of a tall and objecting figure. He sticks it just below my collarbone and that helps, though only a little.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A third slug fires, misses, hit another reveler. The panic in our wake gives us a little distance. My legs are lead; all I understand is that we need to keep moving, that if we see another glossy white face then I’m done for. “Hey, man,” I hear a neikonaut object, as the Chalkers struggle towards us. He gets a backhand to the face for his trouble, but even that buys us a second, and another. And now we’re between black velvet curtains, in a maze of soft nothing. Unseen, Tethi plucks the slugs off me and pushes down to depress the rest of the amphetamine into my chest.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Use yours too,” he insists. “Just a few milligrams.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I stare blankly at where he must be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Your autovial. The fucking DMT. <i>Why</i> did you do that, Mona?”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I flex, and my wanji deposits a second, stranger burst of energy into my thigh. I take off stumbling and half-tranquilized behind him. We’re in the space between spaces, flying between the curtained divisions of Wu Ke Nai He. Tethi’s Contecs flare. The music flows around us from frantic to calm and back and suddenly we’re up against concrete. We wrench open a door. Low light, silent footfall; two Chalkers rush around a sharp corner and Tethi strikes the first in the face with a folding chair, falls into the arms of the second. My perception is mud; I’m on autopilot; I take an elbow to the cheek as I reach for the fallen Chalker’s vialgun, raise it, and depress the trigger. Then twice.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The second shot missed, but it’s enough. Down on his back, Tethi grapples for the folding chair and shoves it leg-first into a spine. A weird, distant moan of pain. I fire again and again, six times, a slug in the back of each of them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Stop,” Tethi shouts. He rips the vialgun from my hands, wipes the sweat from the grip, twists the dial, adjusting the loadout on the vialgun’s tiny display. “Any known cardiovascular risks? Arrhythmia in the family?”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>“What?”</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He shakes his head, curls flying, and fires the last slug into my chest. Whatever’s in there wakes me the fuck up. “Go.”<i> </i>More footfall inbound, but he leads us right, and then left, reading whorls of chalk from the walls. He wrenches open the third door we pass. Hisses triumphantly when he sees descending stairs. Downward, dampward, into the tunnels. We must run half a kilometer before Tethi declares us safe.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“This is neutral ground,” he pants, climbing into an alcove, examining the dripping chalk on the walls. I can’t muster the effort to resist it: as I catch my breath the walls wiggle with slow, neon-bright pulses of information. The tunnels as the Chalkers see them — as illegible to me as it is lovely. Back against the wet walls, knees in my hands, I expect Tethi to excoriate me. But he gets one look at my face and laughs, whoops with triumph until it becomes a cough.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You shot the motherfuckers!”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I — Teth, I am <i>so</i> sorry —”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“That was something else entirely.” He whistles through his front teeth. “Boy, I needed that.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After we catch our breath, sprawled in the oily dust beneath a manhole cover, he opens the rollscroll.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All in all, it’s pretty good data.</span></p>
