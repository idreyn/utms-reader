<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The thick of the crowd gives me a choice: tendrils or elbows. I can just look <i>up</i> at the Ripples and lose myself completely. That’s what everyone’s here to do: Chalker, chaser, neikonaut. Flower crowns, quasi-wands, LED-glow sunflowers raised in saucer-eyed ecstasy. Or I can keep my eyes below meridian, focus on human bodies, on arms and butts and pheromones, looking at <i>you </i>and <i>you </i>and <i>you</i> and <i>sorry, excuse me</i>, pushing through a great collective trance, seeing the wave for its particles. It becomes apparent that there are so many goddamn rooms in this place. Warehouse-sized, closet-sized, the music interpolates seamlessly between all of them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I measure out an upward glance: the Ripples jelly-pulse, whip-shimmer, spiral-bounce. And for all their blind jostling, their flashes of destructive interference, they move far more easily than we do. They brush by so fluidly, that it’s easy to believe that they’re leading the dance.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By and large, they’re moving in the same direction we are.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tethi stows the rollscroll after one last look. There is a clear center to things, a cluster of Introspecs where the debris readouts are so powerful they’ve started feeding static into the sensors. And there are deep veins of it to traverse along the way, where the speakers in the floor resonate with curlicue come-hither whoops, and where the faint light of the quasigrams seems a little more golden. There are people whose glances are barbed with it, whose motions draw in attention and send jagged skewers of reaction back through the crowd. I recognize one of them from my photonics seminar, and I’m very glad she doesn’t recognize me, especially not now. <i>One hit. Just to get your bearings.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>I flex my wrist, and my wanji sends a spike of DMT crashing through the autovial on my thigh. Instantly the characteristic E-flat buzz of the come-up, waves of sickly yellow and green flashing before my eyes, a sudden and elaborate gnosis. It bounces through my neikotic channels, coating them with sticky, staticky little tile-cules of Sieve debris. For the length of a terrible spasm, I have hundreds of limbs, thousands of fingers, my whole being a cartography of the Ripples’ designs on the Sea. I point, and mouth the words, but it’s so loud don’t even bother to shout: <i>This way!</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And as Sieve debris builds up inside me, I feel tentative tugs of Ripples. Wild ones from nameless ravines, who know nothing of gemstone towers or razor-straight sluices of light. I feel them as obscure and igneous sorrows, mantle-hot, mantle-deep. The debris <i>sticks</i> to them. It yields to their clumsy, fluvial manipulations like clay, and it prickles their own contours back to them. Waves of bubble-wrap multiocularity rise and fall as they recognize their own reflections, the very concept of a reflection, and ask: <i>if this is me, then what am I?</i> Would that I could describe the way it feels to be on both sides of the mirror at once.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>“We’re close,”</i> Tethi shouts. He shows me on his wanji how many minutes to moonrise.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At this I begin to lose track of the where and when of things. I flex again, and this time the spike is of purples and purples and <i>purples</i>, but also deep reds and rich browns, like the loam underfoot. I sway in a wind from all directions at once, elbowing and apologizing my way inwards, making contact here with a shoulder and there with a wide, green leaf, hear a shout of protest and turn to see the wide, black face of a sunflower blinking at me, beady seedy eyes each one unseeing but their sum total uncomfortably like the gaze that oh, after all, is from the holder of the beverage I just spilled with a stray swipe...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>“Here,” </i>I read from Tethi’s lips. He brandishes his own wanji and flexes it, hard. <i>“Now.”</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It might be several minutes later, for all I know, or it might be right on his cue: as the harvest moon rises above Shanghai, it plays on the facets of untold millions of cameras, and floods the Sea with brilliant golden light. It rises from tiny whirlpools of whirlpools — and these now collected by the coprocessors into a single, enormously spherical <i>thing</i> lurking just below the surface, throwing the spires and grottos around it into jagged relief, and if the Ripples outside cannot see it they surely pause dumbstruck in its warmth. The collected light twinkles and chimes off the ribbons of Sieve debris, sending pixelated, panchromatic flashes into our collected eyes. In the <i>oohs</i> and <i>ahhs</i> around me, I catch low murmurs of fearful recognition from neikonauts. Already some are trying to escape. These are primer tiles.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Something is knocking at our door in the language of loop-lock.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tethi and I share one last glance, and we face it back to back. And now the Sea crashes undammed onto my head, acceleration to terminal velocity to quadratic offset. An eyeful of salt water of hyperlagmites of sigils. <i>AN EYEFUL OF EYES</i>.<i> AN EYE FULL OF EYES.</i> Tiles flashing faster than I’ve ever seen before, four then sixteen then two million in a single blink. The first few moments have that usual loop-lock feel of quantization and jitter, the closures wrapping my thoughts nesting in elegant tiers, a frosted-glass relief map of my own soul. Only I don’t feel boundaries where I normally do, I feel wide channels, a blurring of edges, a closing of seams. The tiles claw into my vision, turning the world blue and green and yellow.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>“Hey,” </i>I shout to him as our world dissolves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>“Hey what?” </i>He roars back, almost losing his balance.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The glimpse was just that. The thought is absurd. But wasn’t that her, just now, just over there?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>“I think I just saw my advisor.”</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I blink, eyes salty with sweat, in a staring contest with an endless field of sunflowers.</span></p>
