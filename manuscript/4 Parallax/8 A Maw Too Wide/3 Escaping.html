<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The mantra comes as a dazzling, purple-and-white flash of inversion, a tunnel of concentric rings, a release back to the dance floor, and if that wasn’t loop-lock — and in the strictest sense, it wasn’t — it leaves me with the same dusting of technicolor grit on my soul. I catch myself in a two-step stagger cut diagonally through the confused and concerned, just as my hands hit the filthy, sticky floor. Nearby, Tethi is faring only a little better. But if we’re making a scene, so is every other neikonaut nearby. They’re going down like bowling pins, at least those that were clipped by — just what was it? It was the sparkle of moonlight on those ribbons of debris.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I pick out three kinds of crowd noise punching holes in the <i>whump-whump</i> of the trance floor. The first is a roller-coaster <i>oooh</i> and <i>ahhh</i>: the full moon is still rising from petaled whirlpools in the Sea, still infusing the brine with unbearably beautiful veins of gold. The second is from inebriated neikonauts pulled in by the primer tiles, limbs locking and seizing up, screaming as though pushed off a bridge. The third is a fleeing, chatter-scatter retreat from bright columns of xenon-white light, bobbing through the crowd. It’s all just below boiling point.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tethi offers me an arm up, and from his wanji I learn that barely a minute has passed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Was that really you? In there with me?” And if so, was that really <i>Deng?</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We need to go.” Tethi looks eagled-eyed, scouting for a route. “Now.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It looks equally fucked in every direction, so we begin pushing away from the nearest column of light, which is attached to the hand of a Weather Bureau agent. They’re picking their way through the crowd in pairs shouting the things you’d expect, like <i>make way, give ground</i> and <i>please remain calm! </i>The one nearest us seems unsure whether to shine the light into the neikonauts’ eyes or the Mirror Sea cameras. And overhead, a flock of their camballs whirs around, each round little drone staking out its turf, hovering blue LEDs joining the fixed constellations of red. I look back to see Tethi ducking beneath his rollscroll, keeping the contours of his face out of the drones’ view. They’re not <i>doing</i> anything yet, but if they see him they’ll be on him in a second. <i>Red lights near, you’re in the clear. Lights of blue, we’re watching you…</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He shouts a warning into my ear: “This is about to get weird.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Oh, <i>come on. </i>What could you possibly mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He means this: all around us Chalkers descend from the rafters on winches and wire, spider-silent, gargoyle-posed, invisible against the velvet walls until suddenly, they’re not. Just to our left one of them grabs a Weather Bureau woman by the shoulders. She makes an unearthly <i>whoop</i>, a scream through synthvox that dopplers back up through the quasigrams to the ceiling at spine-whipping speeds. Her lantern drops into the crowd, spreading eerie shadows across the filthy floor. And even as confusion turns to panic turns to a lopsided brawl between the Bureau and the Chalk, the trance floor is <i>still</i> trying to make sense of our footfall as halting, skeltering licks and snatches of synth and bass.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>“Please proceed in an orderly manner to the nearest marked ex —”</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And as this next Weather Bureau agent goes leg-up to the rafters, Wu Ke Nai He teeters on the knifepoint of a deadly chaos that makes you <i>wish </i>this place had marked exits. Tethi and I are thirty meters away from anything that might be a wall, our motion random at best. Grimly I consider the value of human life through Chalker eyes: there <i>must </i>be house lights, there <i>must</i> be more ways out. But for them, this is a laboratory. This is a training ground for the wild Ripples, who need to learn to behave, to interact without destructive interference.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Can they? <i>Can we?</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It comes from within the crowd: <i>don’t push, go slow. </i>Not a broadcast, but a whisper: <i>don’t push, go slow.</i> It comes in on locked eyes from nearest neighbors, individual strangers, I won’t if you won’t: <i>don’t push, go slow.</i> It sheds fear and desperation and becomes a rallying cry echoing through the warehouse, picked up by foot-stomp and ratified by the bassline: <i>don’t push, go slow. </i>And — unbelievably, we’ve done it — no one is pushing. We’re all moving slowly, calmly, to the exits. The Weather Bureau is still pouring in, but they’ve lost the xenon lanterns now, these are uniformed medics looking for the injured and tile-shocked…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Don’t push, go slow.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">People are saying it, yes. But I wouldn’t put it in quotes. The more I look — and the more I look, the more I see it — it’s as through the message is being transmitted through the crowd. <i>Don’t push, go slow.</i> Human agency is here, but encoded, amplified, transmitted, and abstracted by something artificially sleek and brand new. It is here for us, but only indirectly, incidentally. It resonates with lower energies in me but not of me, merely learned, merely borrowed for the duration. <i>Don’t push, go slow.</i> And the more I look — something convex goes flat, some certainty drops out, and for a moment I have perfect leeway to choose. Is it us or them? At the end of the day, is it us or them? <i>Don’t push, go slow.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tethi shakes this off like a drizzle. Something buzzes behind his shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Mona, I hate to say this, but I think we have to push.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s terrifying, the idea that we could break the equilibrium and turn this back into a massacre. And it’s curious, the way the crowd seems to part for us and us alone. But to be fair, we alone <i>do</i> have a drone swarm at our backs. It calls out in a fragmented chorus, a butchered transliteration of Tethi’s name, <i>stand down, stand down.</i> In a volley of whirs and clicks it unleashes pea-sized tranq pellets in our general direction, which sting and stick and squish. <i>Mbetethi Okeme, you have committed a tantamount crime against human self-determination, stand down, stand down.</i> And one of them hits my hair, and one of them hits the zipper of my dress, and one of them hits Tethi in the forearm, but he bites it off and spits it to the floor. And all around us people are going down indiscriminately, the whole scene backlit with a strange grace, its brushstrokes lingering in my eyes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“In here.” All of a sudden I’m beneath a waterfall of black velvet and now Tethi grabs my wrist. “Hit that again.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“What? Teth, where —”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He brandishes fresh chalk. “Just trust me.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And I flex, and it hits my bloodstream immediately, the darkness around me a concentricity made of vibrating molecules of cool damp ocean of the beach just before it begins to rain. And Tethi (he is ahead of me, somehow) whips all that away and accelerates into a tunnel innervated with gemstone sconces, studded with architectural sapphire-moss outcrops that you might call balconies. At one of these he skids to a stop and gestures outward, to the great center of their lusciously chromatic city of pinnacles that ever-consume themselves with a languidly mechanical gleam, of wormways burning at their core with high summer’s hottest noon. And in the center, its quick arc-whips already powering it all, is the bulbous core of the Sunflower Sieve. Its sheer brightness puts swarms of Ripples into ecstatic silhouette. To look directly into it is to see all brought down on low heat to viscous essence, to (with ((forever, new) eyes) (always (see (that which is necessary, no more)))).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When it finally passes, when my eyes are at last my own, I’m in a bafflingly comfortable part of the sewers. A little underground one-room safehouse beside a Chalked-up halfpipe creek of this morning’s stormwater. There are shelves of clean pajamas and neat hampers of dirty ones. There is a Cup-Noodle vending machine and a water dispenser in the corner. There are two full bathrooms. Wordlessly, for there is absolutely nothing to say, we shower off the filth of Wu Ke Nai He and take kitty-corner bunks. I try, but don’t know if sleep is possible in my state.</span></p>
