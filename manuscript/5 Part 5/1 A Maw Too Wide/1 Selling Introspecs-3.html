It plays out on genzhe globes, on silkscreens descending like weeping willow, on obelisks of refurbished cell phones, as they converge from every grotto and ravine of the Mirror Sea. They follow thick, golden ribbons of Sieve debris towards <i>something,</i> its outline merely suggested, its gravity unmistakable.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
