<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Above us, around us, the Ripples are on the move. They jelly-pulse, whip-chatter, spiral-bounce, all in the same direction. They wriggle and jostle, passing through their fellows in white-hot bursts, practically annihilating each other in a feverish race inwards. It plays out on genzhe globes, on silkscreens descending like weeping willow, on obelisks of refurbished cell phones, as they converge from every grotto, trench, and plain of the Mirror Sea. In the distance, they slither along thick and glittering ribbons of Sieve debris towards something enormous and gold and round.</span></p>

<p class="p3">“Yep.” His head keeps darting between the rollscroll to the quasigrams overhead. “Sure. Shoot.”</p>
<p class="p3">“Do the Ripples know we exist?”</p>
