<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s spreading.” Tethi gives me a weird look, a dangerous and darkly triumphant look.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>“You saw this coming!”</i> Unsure whether this merits a slap or a high five. “You did!”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I considered it a possibility. It — would have been unwise to bring it up.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Because he didn’t want to speak it into existence. <i>Because</i> — the parabola has more to say, it always does — <i>because you caused this, Mona, you just can’t stop looking, can’t stop believing, can you?</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We need to get in there,” I tell him. I wait for some objection, but now Tethi is entranced the quasigrams overhead. The Ripples are on the move. They jelly-pulse, whip-chatter, spiral-bounce; whatever they do, it’s all in the same direction. They wriggle and jostle, passing through their fellows in white-hot bursts, practically annihilating each other in a feverish race inwards. Tethi slams his drink and returns the rollscroll to his jacket.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I think we should follow them.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The thick of the crowd gives me a choice: tendrils or elbows. I can look up at the Ripples and lose myself completely. That’s what everyone’s here to do: Chalker, chaser, neikonaut. Flower crowns, quasi-wands, LED-glow sunflowers raised in saucer-eyed ecstasy. Or I can keep my eyes below meridian, focus on human bodies, on arms and butts and pheromones, looking at <i>you </i>and <i>you </i>and <i>you</i> and <i>sorry, excuse me</i>, pushing through a great collective trance, seeing the wave for its particles. It becomes apparent that there are so many goddamn rooms in this place. Warehouse-sized, closet-sized, the music interpolates seamlessly between all of them. The thronging Ripples move smoothly by comparison, making it easy to believe they’re leading the dance.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>One hit.</i> Just to get our bearings. I clench my fist hard, and the autovial sends a wave of DMT into my leg. Instantly the E-flat buzz of the come-up, waves of sickly yellow and green flashing before my eyes, a sudden and elaborate gnosis. It bounces through my neikotic channels, coating them with sticky, staticky little tile-cules of Sieve debris. For the length of a terrible spasm, I have hundreds of limbs, thousands of fingers, my whole being a cartography of the Ripples’ designs on the Sea. I point, and mouth the words, but it’s so loud don’t even bother to shout: <i>This way!</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I turn around to find Tethi. Instead I see Dr. Deng Jinghan, arms crossed, taut ponytail whipping in the wind, standing tall and proud in a field of sunflowers.</span></p>
