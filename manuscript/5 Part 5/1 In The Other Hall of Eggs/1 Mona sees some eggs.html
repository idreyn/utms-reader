<p class="p1">I’m actually glad Deng said those things. She’s always had a way of making her points so they echo louder with time, especially the parts like <i>childish,</i> <i>miserable</i>, and so I will be honest: it hardly registers to me that she had a hand in Xia Zitian’s Mirror Sea. Looking back at her reaction today, it’s clear she views this as some soot-stain on her soul which only becomes more vile, year after year, as she contorts to keep it from me. What’s frightening is that the Mona Xu who woke up this morning — wait, Jesus, no, <i>yesterday</i> morning — would have forgiven her for this. Only now she’s reminded me how she really feels, and I can go of all this consternation and heartache. Any second now.</p>
<p class="p1">“What’s going to happen to him?” I ask Rui. The hallway past the Observatory’s lobby looks just how I imagined it: stark while, undecorated, poorly labeled. It calls to mind my time in Weather Bureau custody. “Is <i>this</i> where...?”</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s not where you were detained, no. It’s not where Mr. Okeme is staying, either. They called a veetle for him.”</p>
<p class="p1">“<i>They</i>? Or <i>you</i>?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Mona, the Weather Bureau tries not to take pleasure in its own existence.” He answers me more directly with the sheer number of doors his card unlocks. “It doesn’t hold grudges. Mr. Okeme has been a headache, yes. But if he shows us his ingress to the Mirror Sea — which we know he has — he could be free by nightfall.”</p>
<p class="p1">“And if he doesn’t?”</p>
<p class="p1">“I don’t know what will happen. In general, the Weather Bureau doesn’t detain people indefinitely. It brings in people every day who won’t cooperate, and sooner or later it just has to let them go. It doesn’t have the resources to keep every Chalker behind bars. It doesn’t want to. It just wants to keep the Sea under control.”</p>
<p class="p1">There’s Deng again, ringing louder in my ears: <i>just turn the cameras off!</i></p>
