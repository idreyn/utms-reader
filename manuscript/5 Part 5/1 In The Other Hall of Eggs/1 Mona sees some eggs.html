<p class="p1">High concrete ceilings, exposed steel pillars, ferociously loud ductwork, all in a space too airy to properly heat: on paper, the Weather Bureau’s foothold in YINS is a mechanical floor. I expected more windowless white walls, but we overlook the Huangpu, practically dangle over it. The window unfrosts at my touch, and I peer across the river at ant-crawl traffic, at dog walkers, at a swirling mass of starlings, at the disembarkation of a ferry…</p>
<p class="p1">“Don’t,” Dr. Rui tells me, looking up from his phone call. Yeah, we got him, he was just saying. It’s a weird story, I’ll brief you tonight, don’t take your eyes off him.</p>
<p class="p1">…at the swing of stoplights in wind, at crenelations of low fog, at periodicities of revolving doors, driven by hidden heartbeats, pumped by unnameable organelles of meaning and recurrence. It becomes hard not to see the city the way the cameras do, to look for the coincidences, the synchronicities, at the smallest scale. To know that the Ripples are fashioning spires and guideways for themselves from this fine texture, in the way we walk and smile and slam doors and call elevators and pour tea and tow cars and feed squirrels and swing cranes, and now in the way we see, the way we <i>see…</i></p>
<p class="p1">“Mona, seriously, don’t.” He strides forward, frosts the window from ten paces. He must read something from my queasy expression. “I know what you’re thinking, and it doesn’t help. It’s just playing into their hands.”</p>
<p class="p1"><i>They don’t have hands,</i> I want to say, but it’s feeble, and it dies in my throat. “Do they know?” I ask instead. “Is there any chance that they know, somehow, that they’re…in there? And we’re out here? Do they know what they’re doing?”</p>
<p class="p1">“That they’re reaching upstream and molding a world that is, itself, alive?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah. Exactly. More alive than their own, even.” It’s weird, this defensive pang of pride, sticking up for my own reality.</p>
<p class="p1">“We don’t know.” Dr. Rui idly waves the cylinder of Tethi’s rollscroll. That it’s already back in his hands says something, surely, about his position within the Weather Bureau. “The data that you two collected is the bleeding edge of a knife in their backs. It could tell us a lot. You should be proud.”</p>
<p class="p1">I keep looking away and then back at Dr. Rui. Hoping each time, on first instant, to finally pierce the image of the mild-mannered professor. To rearrange those dark circles and worry lines and nerve-set jaw some other way. To see the hardness in the face of this man who speaks like we’re at war. <i>You should be proud.</i> No, Tethi should be proud. I should be angry, not these five or six flavors of numb.</p>
<p class="p1">“What exactly is going to happen to him?”</p>
<p class="p1">“It depends,” Rui replies airily. I give him a nasty look; he frowns, smiles, frowns. “The Bureau has a short memory. Blue Delta holds the leash, but no one wants to find out how long it is. We try not to hold on to grudges and detainees. Your friend Mr. Okeme has been a big headache, yes, but we hardly hold him solely responsible for the Sieve. If he cooperates — that is to say, if he shows us his ingress to the Mirror Sea — he could be free by nightfall.”</p>
<p class="p1">“And if he doesn’t?” If Tethi won’t bring the Bureau down on Min, on Triple Point?</p>
<p class="p1">“That’s not my specialty.” He looks around as though for backup. But we’re alone among pleather couches and clustered desks and occasional potted plants, and no specific signs that this is the Weather Bureau. Is this unassuming open-plan office some further misdirection? Or — and this seems more likely as I ponder it — perhaps it comes alive at night? Rui springs to his feet. “Follow me. There’s a lot she tried to keep from you, but I know where to start.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">* * *</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Now this is more like it, this dim and sterile room, steel cabinets full of heavy drawers. Rui taps his YINS ID to get in; I have questions, <i>so many</i> <i>questions</i>, but I have a feeling that if I keep my mouth shut he might even answer them.</p>
<p class="p1">“Eggs!” I gasp, stupidly, as he opens one of the drawers.</p>
<p class="p1">“The Sieve is far from the first,” Rui chuckles. Now I’m starting to see his angle, the collector’s glint in his eye. We might be back in his office, with all his glassware. “We wouldn’t presume to have a complete collection, but this is every neikotic egg the Weather Bureau has identified as originating in the Mirror Sea. Ordinarily, when it’s business as usual, we get there first.”</p>
<p class="p1">These first eggs, chronologically ordered, have a primeval quality to them. They tickle my neikotic channels as though with steel wool. But I know it when I see it. I could spend twenty minutes, an hour, pondering one of these, and…what?</p>
<p class="p1">“Mostly nothing of interest,” Rui puts in, reading my mind again. He plucks out a violet lump of voxelite and flips it in his hand. “Hatch them and you’ll find koans, toys, quines. Satisfying as <i>objets d’art</i>, but of no real use. “Do you realize that she’s never mentioned in the Xia Zitian papers, not once?”</p>
<p class="p1">I offer him a baffled, weary look at this hard left turn. <i>Please, for once, be direct.</i></p>
<p class="p1">“Dr. Deng. Not once.” He lets me examine the egg. “And yet there are the fingerprints of a brilliant neikonaut all over it. Valiant attempts to make the Mirror Sea work as originally designed. Fearsome leaps in Lam-Waldmann theory papered over with half-assed derivations. There are holes, too. Scars in email threads left over by resynthesis. Theories about Ripple behavior that are referenced constantly but never explicitly laid out. Most likely she her way with the Papers before she disappeared.”</p>
<p class="p1">“But it was definitely her…?”</p>
<p class="p1">“I know it was her.” Rui smirks. Clearly he’s been waiting to tell me this for a long time. “Because she handed them to me herself. I flatter myself to imagine that she trusted me above anyone else. But more likely, I was the only Blue Delta sympathizer she knew.” He gives me a beat to interject, but all the questions come tumbling out at once and jam my tubes. “In early days, of course, it was easier to interpret this in the sensible way.”</p>
<p class="p1">This catches me for a second, but then I remember the argument that I made to Tethi on my comedown. “The Sea is just a thinking aid.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Precisely so. The egg is only ever just a momentary swirl of noise in the Sea. All the work is in interpretation, the artful direction of attention. Let a neikonaut stare into the Mirror Sea, and they’ll spot patterns already in their mind, kissing the threshold of awareness.” He says this almost incantatively. “And for a while, the Weather Bureau did let them. We find the best way to draw attention to the Sea is to insist too hard on concealing it. The YINS Observatory remained open for use, and a seaborn egg won the occasional neikonaut their doctorate. They were never loud about it. It was a blemish we encouraged them not to dwell on. The Big Three caught wind, and quietly began to buy up feeds, but they were more secretive still.”</p>
<p class="p1">Rui lingers on each of the eggs. As we traverse the cabinets, they become more symmetrical, more elegant, more useful. Each is labeled with the name of a neikonaut, an attempt to describe its location in the Sea, and another to relay what the egg contains. Mostly rather vague and mystical: <i>telltale wingbeats; repeated unfurlings; a way to see the same thing twice.</i> But two or three of them are algorithms that were considered state-of-the-art. My heart almost stops when I see the one labeled <i>Tenfold Gate.</i></p>
<p class="p1">“Do you remember this?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Do I <i>remember</i> it?” Of course I remember Tenfold Gate. The vomit-soaked scanners, the week of canceled exams, and…Cai. “Yeah. Of course I do.”</p>
<p class="p1">“We begged Deng — oh, we <i>begged</i> her to come up to the Observatory to see where Chaoyue found it. Abandoned in a little carved-out redoubt at the edge of one of the Sea’s great plateaus. From soberspace it looked like embers in a taillight campfire. Every neikonaut in the city was using it, and it was twisting their cognition like a wet towel, and lucky for that.”</p>
<p class="p1">“The debris was so bad…”</p>
<p class="p1">“…that it couldn’t be ignored. We thought that was the direction this was heading. Nastier debris, stronger inversions, an arms race in the clinic. We were wrong.” And no points for guessing which egg Rui next raises to the light, golden and soft. “Do remember what I once told you about debris and soberware?”</p>
<p class="p1">“That debris is no model for soberware. It’s everything you don’t want.”</p>
<p class="p1">Rui nods. “Yes. And I was being truthful then, and I was wrong. The Sunflower Sieve’s debris is really better thought of as soberware. Now that it has…unfurled…it’s easy to ignore in your own cognition if you don’t know how to look. I have to admit, the Ripples have done what I was beginning to think was impossible. It’s fully functional soberware. It’s mostly inert, although it clearly reacts strongly to the presence of Mirror Sea displays.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“But what is it <i>for?</i>”</p>
<p class="p1">Rui chops his palm. “…Is <i>precisely</i> the wrong question. Imagine machines arriving from the stars to terraform Earth. Synthesizing novel compounds from our atmosphere. Building beautiful structures of no clear purpose. Would we pause to ask what it’s <i>for?</i>” Of course not, he means to imply. But our own pause here betrays us. “That’s what they’re doing to our minds.”</p>
<p class="p1">“So…so what’s left to do? Take down the displays? The cameras?”</p>
<p class="p1">I have the sense that if the Mirror Sea was ever really confined to the displays and the cameras, that time has long passed. And I think Rui does too, with his uneasy sigh. “You can manufacture one of those cameras for ten ping. You can practically print one now. The Lam-Waldmann Hash is public knowledge. If anything, the Weather Bureau is trying to put up <i>more</i> displays, just so we control some appreciable fraction of them.”</p>
