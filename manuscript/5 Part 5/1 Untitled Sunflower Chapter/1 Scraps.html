<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Maybe they were.” But he sounds unconvinced. “Maybe they...what are you doing?”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I’m holding the rollscroll up to my face. I’m trying to see these ragged readouts with fresh eyes. <i>That could be noise.</i> Sensor malfunction, radio interference, anything in between. But then why do I see those spiral-claw-combs? <i>Why is it so hard to look away? </i>If Sunflower Sieve debris is capable of sliding into the minds of non-neikonauts, that changes the parameters of the entire experiment. I don’t have time to reprogram it now. <i>By the way, it’s your fault, Mona.</i> The parabola has something to add, it always does. <i>You just can’t look away, can you?</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We need to get in there,” I insist, and wait for him to protest.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But Tethi’s barely listening. His eyes are tracing the quasigrams overhead. Some of the wild Ripples are are vast and polycentric, lurking in the saddle-points of the backscreens, feeding via interference. But most of them are moving. They jelly-pulse, whip-chatter, or spiral-bounce, but all in the same direction. They wriggle and jostle, passing through their fellows in white-hot bursts, practically annihilating each other in a feverish race inwards. Tethi slams his glass and returns the rollscroll to his jacket. “I think we should follow them.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The thick of the crowd gives me a choice: tendrils or elbows. I can look up at the Ripples and lose myself completely. That’s what everyone’s here to do: Chalker, chaser, neikonaut. Flower crowns, quasi-wands, LED-glow sunflowers raised in saucer-eyed ecstasy. Or I can keep my eyes below meridian, focus on human bodies, on arms and butts and pheromones, looking at <i>you </i>and <i>you </i>and <i>you</i> and <i>sorry, excuse me</i>, pushing through a great collective trance, seeing the wave for its particles. It becomes apparent that there are so many goddamn rooms in this place. Warehouse-sized, closet-sized, the music interpolates seamlessly between all of them. The Ripples move so much faster than we do that it’s easy to believe they’re leading the dance.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>One hit.</i> Just to get our bearings. I clench my fist hard, and the autovial sends a wave of DMT into my leg. Instantly the E-flat buzz of the come-up, waves of sickly yellow and green flashing before my eyes, a sudden and elaborate gnosis. It bounces through my neikotic channels, coating them with sticky, staticky little tile-cules of Sieve debris. For the length of a terrible spasm, I have hundreds of limbs, thousands of fingers, my whole being a cartography of the Ripples’ designs on the Sea. I point, and mouth the words, but it’s so loud don’t even bother to shout: <i>This way!</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But when I turn around to find Tethi, I see Dr. Deng Jinghan, arms crossed, standing in a field of sunflowers.</span></p>
