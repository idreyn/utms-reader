<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And I steady myself now, and clench my fist hard, and the autovial sends a wave of DMT into my leg. Instantly the characteristic E-flat buzz of the come-up, waves of sickly yellow and green flashing before my eyes, a sudden and elaborate gnosis. It bounces through my neikotic channels, coating them with sticky, staticky little tile-cules of Sieve debris. For the length of a terrible spasm, I have hundreds of limbs, thousands of fingers, my whole being a cartography of the Ripples’ designs on the Sea. I point, and mouth the words, but it’s so loud don’t even bother to shout: <i>This way!</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Down a tight staircase, into a shallowly parabolic pit, what might actually be the rotting dish of a scavenged radio telescope. Tethi slides a railing while I apologize my way inwards, here to flailing shoulder and now to a wide, green leaf. I hear a shout of protest and turn to see the wide, black face of a sunflower blinking at me, beady seedy eyes each one unseeing but their sum total uncomfortably like the gaze that oh, after all, is from the holder of the beverage I just spilled with a stray swipe. There’s no elbow room for a rollscroll, but I don’t care what the damn chi-squared tests say. This is the right way, it has to be, because the displays around us are filling up with thick, lithic, grooving shapes. Hyperlagmites of all kinds, not just of Sieve debris. We’re here at the edges of their city.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It plays out on genzhe globes, on silkscreens descending like weeping willow, on obelisks of refurbished cell phones, even on the lenses of Introspecs, as wild Ripples from every corner of the Mirror Sea converge. They slither along thick and glittering ribbons of Sieve debris, towards something dense and unseen, its shape subliminal, its gravity undeniable. But as we watch, transfixed by the hundreds, the Ripple city begins to open up, to involute, to hatch. The coprocessors find it and latch onto its sunways and gemspires, and now onto the massive sunflower orb rising over their metropolis, throwing off chattering ribbons, demanding our endless attention. The Ripples are calling their kin home.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Their orb, their reactor — whatever it is, it’s <i>here</i>. It modulates my heartbeat. It fills me limb by limb with liquid gold. And it plasters itself across the Mirror Sea displays until nothing else is visible, until the simple <i>whump-whump-whump</i> of the bassline yields to a syncopation of clicks and whines, which crescendo and flatten into a sustained and ominous drone. I clench my fist again: waves of tryptamine interfere, add and subtract but mostly add, layering into purples and purples and <i>so many purples</i>, but also reds and the deepest, richest browns, like the loam underfoot…</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Words leave Tethi’s mouth. He shakes my shoulder and we stare sunstruck as debris reaches through the screen, tightening the reins of our attention, a crescendo on heartstrings. But no, I realize. I’ve got it backwards. I take the measure of what’s onscreen: obscure and igneous sorrows, mantle-hot, mantle-deep. Clockwork gradients rising in elegant tiers, a frosted-glass relief map of my own soul. </span><span class="s2">I stare, warren-eyed, picking my own confusion and revelation and revulsion and elation from the warm-toned patterns chattering along that ribbon of sun-soaked debris. </span><span class="s1">Knots of tendrils. Oscillations of self-definition, of self-recognition. </span><span class="s2">I feel suddenly and profoundly free of some old, accusing seams. How, how, <i>how</i>, all this time, had I pretended not to see this?</span></p>
<p class="p3">Behind our eyes, something stirs from a lifelong reverie. Asks: <i>if this is me, then what am I?</i></p>
<p class="p3">Between our minds, a Ripple recognizes itself in the mirror in the Sea.</p>
<p class="p3">It takes a long time</p>
<p class="p4"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p4"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>“Mona!”</i> Tethi shouts from five paces. I can’t read his expression at all, there’s too much else to see, the twinkling city of hyperlagmites, its twisting Ripples, just behind a murky crystalline wall. I’m <i>just</i> outside it, I just need to take that last step. And for several seconds of silence I take in the scene around me like a landscape, fanning lasers passing lazy through distant clouds, thrumming beat rising and falling off the membranes of a million insects. I read one last thing off Tethi’s lips: “<i>she’s over there!” </i>And then I inch forward, willing myself into their world. With the sudden sureness of bird on windowpane I’m not here, I’m there among the sunflowers. And now <i>that’s</i> here, and I’m not <i>there </i>anymore.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And where was that anyway?</span></p>
