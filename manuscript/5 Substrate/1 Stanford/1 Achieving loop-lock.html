<p class="p1">The machine at Stanford was dangerous in a number of ways, and the Institutional Review Board was finding more every day. It was my job to fill out the forms that they’d send up to our dry but meticulously dust-free stucco lab at the edge of campus. They would have questions — about voltages, dose-response curves, psychological baselines — and I became adept at answering them in Deng’s voice, with her trademark deflection. It was not that I had to lie to them about what we planned to do with a UTMS scanner and industrial quantities of DMT. But I did have to fashion a kind of viscous bubble of confusion around the project. Sludgy narrative tar-traps that the IRB would count their waking hours against and eventually give in to. I learned from the best.</p>
<p class="p1">“Okay, they have questions about eye strain,” I would shout across the lab, during early autumn afternoons when I should have been in class. “They want to know how many lumens the headset gives off. And whether we can shift the colors off the blue side of the spectrum.”</p>
<p class="p1">Then that descending whir as she shut down the scanner bed and crawled out from under it. “Do you think,” she would grumble, brandishing a multimeter, “that they understand what it is we’re trying to do here?”</p>
<p class="p1">Six of us had to sign special waivers from the university, the city of Palo Alto, the state of California and its quasi-sovereign candy shell. We had been drawn from the fat intersection of Stanford’s giant cognitive science department and its even larger circle of drug enthusiasts. We had been trained on the fundamentals: processor architecture and qualia-wave mechanics and the teachings of Zhuangzi. We were to be the first neikonauts west of the Mississippi. I was the youngest by far.</p>
<p class="p1">“You first,” we’d mutter to each other, only half kidding, watching the engineers add ramshackle patches and eleventh-hour coolant tubes to the machine. YINS had actually sent us an entire Kanwei Python to train on, but it arrived in shattered pieces, reeking of foul play. This set Deng back about five minutes. She bought a regular transcranial magnetic stimulation bed and fashioned it into the thing we needed. Charging its supercapacitors had, several times, knocked out the soccer field’s floodlights.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>the end, I went third. I took an evening time slot, and was at the lab just as the sun disappeared behind the foothills. There had been no mailing list chatter about the day’s first two sessions, which I took to mean they hadn’t gone well. The look on Deng’s face confirmed this as I arrived. Her technicians were visible, barely, inside a maze of matte black Dell monitors. A lot was riding on tonight.</p>
<p class="p1">“Are you ready?”</p>
<p class="p1">In our final days of training she had steered us away from the technical stuff and begun to pump us full of koans. Those rattled between my ears as I was fitted with sensors and tubes. <i>Two fields of poppies grow side-by-side. </i>I would have been muttering this to myself as they tightened the visor around my head.<i> Why do they not grow together?</i></p>
<p class="p1">Then I was supine in powder-blue scrubs, alone in the scanner room. Voices in my ear plowed steadily through checklists and failsafes.</p>
<p class="p1">“Point two seven five milligrams per second squared, standard curve.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Manifold pre-lock in nine…eight…”</p>
<p class="p1">Deng’s voice cut into a countdown just then, staccato and nervous, a recitation in classical Chinese: “Between man and butterfly there is necessarily a distinction.”</p>
<p class="p1"><i>This woman.</i> I had never met anyone like her: she held this entire loop-lock system in her head, had designed it half from scratch in six months. There was nothing happening in this room that she didn’t fully understand. I smiled and allowed myself to relax. “This transition is called the transformation of material things.” I finished the verse, barely, feeling my tongue go thick.</p>
<p class="p1">STAND BY FOR TILES.</p>
<p class="p1">The DMT hit my bloodstream almost immediately. My vision, my headspace, went symmetric and insectoid and alien. It was always like this, the feeling that I had been away a long time, and was finally coming home. But I had to remember: tonight would be different. I let the drug move me but soon I began to move back, feeling out the depths in my vision to hallucinate the clockwork of a processor, my finger its metronome. <i>I’m thinking like the computer and the computer is thinking like me. </i>Deng had said we would have to meet it a little more than halfway.</p>
<p class="p1">And then, from the visor, light. Solid red, of the very center of the earth, which melted smoothly into magmatic orange and yellow. Eruption to the surface, to interlocking fields of lime and emerald, and then into sky blue, deepest sapphire and indigo, then the violet of night, of the stars behind the stars. Then red again. The cycle gathered speed, and I knew that I was mirroring it, that the colors would continue behind closed eyelids. And I knew there was a mental move I needed to make, an assertion of something like control…</p>
<p class="p1"><i>RED. Red red red red red.</i></p>
<p class="p1">I grasped, and the cycle ground to a halt. <i>Red red red red red. </i>Magnets clicked and warbled unhappily at my temples. I blinked my eyes closed and there it was, roiling, howling, untold fathoms of loon-eyed malice. Open again and the same color exactly, stuttering in tight styxward spirals. <i>Red red red red.</i> It was all there was, this knowing glowing campfire <i>red</i>, not scarlet or crimson or cardinal but <i>red red red</i> just <i>red</i> it closed around me, thumping through me, drowning thought and sensation, rising past my high-water mark, any scrawled notch of past psychosis. I was breaking myself to become this color to perceive it to venerate it to actualize the concept of it. I was the very conduit by which it became reality, a brutally simple solution to a hard problem. I would never be anything else but <i>red,</i></p>
<p class="p1"><i>red red red red red</i></p>
<p class="p1"><i>red red red blue red</i></p>
<p class="p1">No thinking or remembering just now, but knowing: that this particular moment had been the focus of all our neikonaut training. There was a kernel of something else, shrinking fast, in the center of all this <i>red</i>, but I to focus elsewhere focus just past it. <i>There is another color. </i>This was scrawled on a chalkboard once, and she had us recite it, chant it eyes-on-eyes until we gasped for air, until we broke from sleep screaming it to terrified roommates. <i>There is another color.</i> It <i>red </i>was <i>red</i> impossible <i>red</i> to <i>red </i>believe <i>red</i> it, but we simply had to believe it, and believe that believing it would make it true. <i>There is another color.</i> There was a different frequency, maybe. A background note of summerday, discordant in its beauty.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">There <i>is</i> another color.</p>
<p class="p1">There is <i>another</i> color.</p>
<p class="p1">There is another <i>color.</i></p>
<p class="p1">That thought spread out like a Cheshire smile. It was working, and because it was working, it was working. I was about to invent another color.</p>
<p class="p1"><i>Red red red red</i></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Red blue red red</i></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Red blue red blue</i></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Red blue blue blue</i></p>
<p class="p1">And I believed it into existence, that next tile. It burst cloudless and heavendeep into the visor, a wide-open resonator for birdsong, <i>blue blue blue blue blue </i>of tears of relief of possibility because I was thinking like the computer and the computer was thinking like me and two things were enough, you could build everything out of that. <i>Blue blue blue blue</i> bluebell bluebird blueberry I hit terminal velocity and could have fallen through that <i>blue</i> all night. But training was really kicking in, the registers and busways of the processor searing deeper into my mind. I was ready to do it again.</p>
<p class="p1"><i>Blue blue blue blue GREEN.</i></p>
<p class="p1">I came down to as much applause as ten people could possibly muster. There was hooting and cheering and a tear or two. The postdocs stamped their feet, clasped their hands, scrubbed the footage. Onscreen they circled the twists in my ‘folds that appeared as I mastered the color changes: from red to blue to green to yellow and soon in any order I pleased. Deng stood in the back, beaming at me, but she put a hand over my glass after my first sip of champagne.</p>
<p class="p1">“That was just one tile,” she said of my loop-lock session. Not dismissively; conspiratorially. She was ready for more. “Think you could manage four?”</p>
<p class="p1">It was the first day of my life.</p>
