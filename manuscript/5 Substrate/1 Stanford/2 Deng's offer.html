<p class="p1">Deng concluded that it was safer to build a second scanner than to move this one from the edge of campus. The engineers grumbled about how much work this would be, all the grant money they’d need to spend, how much smaller and more elegant this new iteration could be. December came and went. I failed two of my classes, and Deng yanked hard on some strings to keep me off probation, so I could do six sessions a day tiling deeper into the machine. In the moment I felt I made this choice lucidly. It sure felt good to be her favorite. Her favorite <i>what,</i> though?</p>
<p class="p1">Student, maybe: we spent hours together, poring over the history and theory and culture of neikotics. <i>In Shanghai,</i> half her sentences began. She unpacked dusty boxes of voxelite whatsits and claimed that there were deep reserves of knowledge lurking inside. Perhaps I was her favorite…test subject? Sometimes that felt more accurate, especially as I struggled to grasp the blackboard math of what was happening in her machine. She was oddly cavalier about that: <i>it will all make sense in loop-lock.</i> One session, a pre-lock hook failed and I was treated to a plain old bad DMT trip, immobilized by panic and foam-lined restraints. Deng herself pulled me from the scanner and asked me a litany of questions, rushing quickly past <i>are you alright</i> towards <i>can you make this motion with your fist</i> and <i>please blink your eyes left-left right-right, </i>as though she had tweezed me from the motherboard to test for defects. Maybe I was her favorite <i>part.</i></p>
<p class="p1">It was the middle of April of my junior year. The second scanner was more reliable but somehow even louder, so when we wheeled it into a lecture hall for a demonstration, we kept the first six rows empty. Deng began by introducing me, and I peeked out of the tube to applause and general mirth. She had a magician’s stage presence, and she used it to explain how a certain encryption scheme had long been considered unbreakable, but tonight, <i>but tonight. </i>Tonight<i> </i>I will saw this young woman in half. “What you’re seeing on the projector is what Mona is seeing now on the visor,” I heard her say. “As she makes contact with the computer these patterns will become more and more detailed, until they become pixel dust, a map of a world that only she can see.”</p>
<p class="p1">And then I was gone and I was back to a standing ovation. Whatever I did in there made a lot of VCs very happy, and some of them approached me discretely at the reception. <i>We love Deng,</i> they said. <i>We all love Deng,</i> <i>but we’re looking for someone a little more aligned with our strategic concerns. If we gave you a lab, do you think you could rebuild it?</i> I was so drunk that I was glowing, and I joked that I would try.</p>
<p class="p1">The next afternoon Deng led me on a walk back out by the Dish, to tell me she was leaving. She stopped me mid-pleasantry and blurted it out. “I’ve been offered a position at YINS.”</p>
<p class="p1">I blinked back.</p>
<p class="p1">“The Yangtze Institute of Neikotic Studies, in Shanghai.”</p>
<p class="p1">“No, I know what it is, but...when? Are you going to take it?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Last night, and this autumn, and yes, I am, Mona. Stanford has been what it needed to be, but I’ve been away from home for far too long.” We took ten long strides up a cresting hill, past the wildgrass. Deng kicked a rock through this silence, double-balancing a mental ledger, finding some dram of courage, and spoke. “In turn, I am offering you a position as my student.”</p>
<p class="p1">“You want <i>me</i> to come with you?”</p>
<p class="p1">“I...yes. I do.” She flashed that tired smile of hers and then rushed on. “There would be logistics to manage, and a great deal to catch you up on, and your Mandarin needs a certain degree of improvement, but I think it would be good. For both of us. I could use someone like you around.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Dr Deng.” And here the obvious struck me. “I’m a junior. I have a year left here.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, well...from the perspective of YINS, that’s no problem. You would begin as a first-year doctoral student.”</p>
<p class="p1">“I have classes to finish. I have to write a <i>thesis</i>, or something, I think. Or I won’t get a degree.”</p>
<p class="p1">“You’ll get another one.” She sounded awfully chipper about this. “A better one. I’m working with the assumption that you want to be a neikonaut. Right? And if so, there’s nowhere better to be than Shanghai. In a lot of ways, there’s nowhere else. Mona, the scanner that I built here is, I’m sorry, it’s garbage. It’s a bucket of parts. You have not tasted the first spoonful of what a person can do in loop-lock. Or to work among those who really understand the mind in neikotic terms. That is on the table for you now.”</p>
<p class="p1">“This fall?”</p>
<p class="p1">“This fall.” She was insistent here. “The neikotics program at Stanford is not going to survive in any form I can condone. When I leave, the vultures from Sand Hill Road are going to pick it clean of postdocs. If this is what you want...” And it was. She knew it was, it was all she had to say. “...then this is it.”</p>
<p class="p1">I asked if I could think about it. She told me that, given what a big decision it was, I would have until the end of the week. I tried to think it all the way through, but my surroundings were already shrinking in the rearview mirror. My parents? My bare handful of friends here? A long time ago, I imagined a degree from Stanford was the thing, and maybe the only thing, that would make me happy. More recently I hoped it would make me sane. But what was it, really? A piece of paper with my name on it? A life jacket to keep my head above water, circulating clockwise around the filth of the Bay? I already knew so much about YINS that I would be embarrassed to admit it to Deng. I hadn’t even needed to tamp down the thought, because you needed to be a <i>genius</i> to go to there. But it was on the table.</p>
<p class="p1">“I think you’d like Shanghai,” she mused, as stopped for a break, resting against a fence. “You know, whole months go by in Palo Alto where I feel only half-awake. Half-alive, even. <i>Don’t worry, it’ll be over soon</i>, should be the motto here<i>.</i> You never feel like that in Shanghai. There’s always something to see, to eat, to do. Some decision to make.”</p>
<p class="p1">“I’ve heard some crazy things about Shanghai.” Wasn’t it run by street gangs that spent their entire lives in some kind of drugged-out ritualistic trance? How’s that for<i> half-awake?</i></p>
<p class="p1">Deng snorted. She really did. “That’s mostly hearsay and propaganda. Internal propaganda as much as anything, you know. The ruling party makes a big deal out of the stranger elements because they’ve deemed it good for tourism.” She began to lapse into Mandarin here. “The truth is that Shanghai has worn many faces, been through a great deal, and it’s always kept the same heart.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Why did you leave?” It was a question I’d never thought to ask. I felt bad about that, suddenly.</p>
<p class="p1">“I’m sorry?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Shanghai. It sounds like it means a lot to you. Why did you leave to begin with?”</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s a long, boring, and <i>very </i>political story.” Deng laughed, and then she gestured up the trail — <i>time to keep moving.</i> Just over the next hill, Stanford’s great radio telescope gleamed in the setting sun. “I’ll tell you some other time.”</p>
