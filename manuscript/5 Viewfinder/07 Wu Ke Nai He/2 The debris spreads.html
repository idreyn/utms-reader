<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They rise in soft, vague columns of quasigraphic light. They slicker rectilinearly along silkscreen mazes, lurking in foggy saddle-points, feeding via interference. No scarce and wispy tendrils, either. These are prime cuts, enough geometry to make sense of a Ripple as a whole. Cheetah-space phase-field rings, chains of polygon shatter, peeling and selfsame cactus-blooms: adequate description of these patterns would come with a strobe warning, but <i>bright</i> white, colorbled at the fringes. And on beat with the music, with its smeared echoes, fed by directly by steel columns of silver teardrops, infrared rings the color of nothing, packing the ceiling, packing the walls, blooming from table centerpieces. We move to the beat and the Ripples move in response, closing the loop from camera to screen to camera, feedback loops riding the ceiling, teasing the exponential. A loose, juicy wave passes behind my eyes and suddenly I’m lost, profoundly lost, in the crowd. My vision goes wide — I only need eyes to see that <i>here</i> is <i>there</i>, I don’t even have to pretend...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Mona!” Tethi’s voice narrows it way down. His hand finds an arm, leads its owner off the ground and around a circular velvet outcrop. I swear it takes a revolution and a half to get to the bathrooms. He leans me <i>(oh — me)</i> against a wall. “Are you going to be all right in here?”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I just didn’t...” says something called Mona, a lost love, a favorite flavor. “It’s a bit more than I expected.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Yeah. That’s what people say.” Sympathy from a distance. For Tethi, this place is a crude condensation, even a parody, of a deeper and more fulsome relationship with the Ripples. But Wu Ke earns its sheen of danger. People hear <i>it’s where the Ripples bring us to dance</i>, and realize it’s true. The quadratically inclined disappear the same night.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We flatten the rollscroll on a high-top, brightness down, sipping uppers and lime. Our mesh network of headsets, all triangulating each others’ locations, has long since thinned into the crowd. The music feeds thumping correlations in their debris. The readouts are choppy things, sixteen pixels to a side, but another layer of software weaves them together into something like Yao’s model. If it’s right — if any of this is real — then this is the Ripples’ sunflower structure we’ve found in their minds. And we are very, very near the center.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Yo,” Tethi whispers. We’ve been getting glances, and he sounds even more on edge now. “Numbers eighteen and nineteen.” And the debris from those headsets looks very weak. Maybe the batteries are dying —</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Oh. <i>Oh.</i> They were the Ripple-dancers, Tethi, <i>those weren’t neikonauts!</i>”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“There must be something wrong with the Introspecs.” His face falls and falls as he flips through the readouts. We sold dozens of headsets to people without neikotic channels, and wrote them off as a bust, and now practically every one of them is lighting up with Sieve debris. “It’s just not possible. You would know, Mona, you’re the expert.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My mouth tightens at the edges. “I’ve never heard of it happening. I don’t know how exactly it would work.” But now the rhythm and the lasers and the fog all fade away as I consider the question. Even at the psychosis-worn fringes of the literature, there’s nothing about neikotic debris sliding through crowds on glance and gesture. But if it were happening, if it <i>were</i> possible…it would begin here. It would be nothing more than a bad pattern that flashes, almost randomly, through the Mirror Sea — a pattern that grabs drug-addled, laser-blinded minds, apertures jammed open, and doesn’t let go. Quadratic belief would reinforce it in mind after mind, until it infects the motion of the crowd and gets picked up on the cameras, and now it’s there again, reinforcing itself, weaving into and out of the Sea. It would have to be miraculously, meticulously engineered. It would only have to happen once.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And what is my reward for believing in it? Thick, golden ribbons of debris revealed in their full brightness, poked and prodded by wild Ripples, delighting in the how prods back, diffusing its scrambling alphabet of shapes into the murk. This picked up subconsciously by the crowd, played back by the trance floor in syncopated clicks and whirs, reappearing in the patterns seen by the Mirror Sea, floaters in dragonfly eyes. </span><span class="s2"><i>What’s happening out there is happening in here. </i>The implications are obscure but nooselike, with the acrid smell of unhappy coincidence, the foreclosure of possibility into claustrophobic grooves. <i>The loop is closing, tightening.</i> The more we look, the more we’ll see. And the more we see, the closer we’ll look. I</span><span class="s1">f all of these people, regular people, are carrying traces of Sieve debris, what could the Ripples make us see? What could they make us do?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is, upon some reflection, hardly stranger than loop-lock. Once a neikonaut establishes contact with a scanner, it does shockingly little. Its magnets reach barely a centimeter past the cranium, just into the magnetic pockets of consciousness on the surface of the brain, and then only to gently reinforce a connection borne almost entirely on sight and correlation: root-level, bone-dry faith shared by you and the computer, that each knows what the other will do next. <i>It loops because it loops, rises because it rises.</i> And here we are, Mona and Tethi — or maybe Xu and Okeme, in the vein of Lam and Waldmann or Deng and Rui, a collaboration for the ages. The Ripples are not careful scientists, but they are, in the end, scientists all the same. Do they know that we are too? Do they know that we’re here at all?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>“I’m going in there,”</i> I shout, directly into Tethi’s ear.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">His eyes widen and then narrow as he realizes what I’m saying. <i>“What on earth for?”</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yeah, Mona, what for? Is it a researcher’s curiosity, instrumental, mechanical, cool to the touch? A clinician’s concern, warm and lemon-scented, spring-loaded, oath-bound to meet the moment? Maybe it’s something that glows hot and mindless in the dark, a connoisseur’s sick delight, to be sampled only under Wu Ke Nai He’s velvet veil? It’s all of this, intermingled, indistinguishable. I can help, but first and foremost, I <i>need</i> to know. And not to justify or explain that need — and that’s the condition, it’s always been the condition, since I first dusted off the Deng Bridge. An unexpected conviction passes through me: she, of all people, will understand.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>“Science,” </i>I shout back, as the whump-whump of the bass flattens into a sustained and ominous drone. “Or something. Are you coming or what?”</span></p>
