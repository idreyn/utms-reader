<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She — <i>she</i> had been here! But the lapse is momentary. <i>Who</i>, Mona?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The heat must be getting to me. How many hours have I been chasing the sun through these wildflowers?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It’s absurd enough that this was my plan, more absurd still that for a long time, it appeared to work. What kind of stars, what kind of moon, will be here to light my path when my legs finally falter and the sun sets? It’s a risk I can’t afford to take, so I’ve been trudging steadily west, jogging in bursts, and keeping that sun above me. If that’s what it really is. I hear it throwing off low rumbles and wind chime harmonics, and I find I can stare at it without pain, even strain my eyes to unpack its bright white into fine swirls of gold. But whenever I look back up, it seems to have moved much further west, so for now I keep it in the corner of my mind.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Instead I focus on the sunflowers and, in their own way, they focus on me. Each has at its center a thousand tiny onyx eyelets which form a large compound eye, with such hazy perception that you may stand in front of one for the span of ten breaths and make no more than the slightest smudge on its world. But plant them together and their roots tangle and intersect, sharing and elaborating on the same great image until they not only see you, but seem to anticipate you. I crane my neck backwards now: in the uncountable miles of them, rising and falling on shallow hills, I can make out the gentlest trace of my presence. They have turned, too subtly to notice in the moment, to face me as I pass. Spend all day in the sunflowers and you begin to exist solely on their terms, your soul knit from grass and dew coursing through your veins, no trouble swifter than a hungry caterpillar even in the spectrum of your attention.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And spend too long away from the flowers, well, I shudder to think. I might buy a few minutes on the glance of a blackbird hanging off a reed, or by grinding my feet into the dirt to cave in an anthill, but the fabric of causality is ever-mending and ever-spooling into unseen depths. To be stitched out takes far less than I once thought: a few minutes in unobserved stillness will do it. I could rise from my reverie and find that the universe has simply moved on without me, along a simpler course through time that carries no trace of my past and leaves me no way back into the future. That such a thing has never been observed in missing socks, in hibernating raccoons, in elderly neighbors, is less than cold comfort — it is precisely the point. The truest terror is just out of our peripheral vision, on the lip of a maw too wide to see through our telescopes. Death is a smokescreen. We are right to fear it, but as the proximate cause of <i>this</i>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And the sun is lower in the sky now, and the sunflowers can’t see in the dark.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are others here — mere rustling disturbances in distance stalks, hints of bipedal motion. So when I finally admit that I need a break, even under this reddening sky, I come to a stream and hope against hope that someone just as thirsty as I am will be there too. Time passes so strangely here that my exhausted stumbling towards the water, collapsing on the ground, and drinking my fill, are stretched into the same rubber-band present, finally snapping loose as I dunk my head underwater for the third or fourth time. <i>You’re going to die here, Mona</i>. <i>You’re going to go unseen and slip away.</i> Already I feel the creep of other possibilities that neatly fill my little vacuum in spacetime. I see it now in the widening bell curve of faces shimmering back on the surface of the stream, my close bob lengthening and my narrow face filling out. {{Mona Xu,}} I say out loud, trying to remember what it’s worth. No one is around to care.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Only...there is someone.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">{{You’re not her,}} comes a high, crisp voice behind me. A whirlwind reorientation, a twanging oscillation that sets my back foot in the stream. When I find myself again in the space between self and other, I’m butt down in the mud, and there’s a face looking up — <i>wait, no, focus, Mona</i> — down at me. A face shimmering between features, but all centered on — <i>am I doing this, or is she? </i>— centered around something familiar. She offers no hand up. If she offers any reaction at all to my fall, it’s in the upper harmonics of her sneer. I scramble to my feet, and find something that passes for a voice.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">{{Dr. Deng?}}</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">{{You’re not her,}} the Deng-thing repeats. {{Maybe she doesn’t work here anymore.}} Its tone level and assessing, stony gaze cutting clear through. And I say <i>Deng-thing</i> because it can’t be her, it just can’t, not even with that signature sigh of disappointment. Not even because she looks unstuck in time, betraying no particular age between ten years my senior or forty centuries old. She — it — steps forward and takes me by the chin with a cool, indifferent left hand. Inspects me at what feels like a molecular level. {{Ah — but you know her, don’t you? After all this time, under the circumstances, I did very well indeed...}}</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Frozen, remembering to move, so the sunflowers will see me. They turn to face the Deng-thing — but no, that’s not quite right. The seconds drip viscously by, and I glimpse inverted causality. It follows the flowers. They project it. And it has my attention with a finger-snap of tiles — <i>tiles, Mona</i>, but the thought is too fleeting — and it’s tearing me apart with its gaze. There’s something utterly feral about the way it rifles through me for memory after memory of the Deng I know: now a half-smile in the dim light of her office, now a hurry-along gesture on the sloping hills behind Stanford, now a vexed frown under the low ceiling of the clinic...</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"><i>{{</i></span><i>You were never one for action. Too passive.}}</i> It spear-fishes with its eyes, probing me for one more, just one more glance of the Deng I know — it looks disgusted and insatiable in equal measure — <i>just one more</i>. It half-drowns me in its caustic haze, but I’m nothing but a looking-glass, dripping with the molar vitriol it reserves for itself alone. <i>{{Unwilling to do what it takes. Too comfortable in stillness.}}</i></p>
<p class="p2">{{I’m here,}} I hear myself shout. {{Talk to <i>me!</i>}}</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">{{Show her what I show you,}} the thing hisses. Then it slinks away, on foot or not, into the stalks.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Night crashes down in a blink. I try to follow, cursing precious minutes lost, any hydration gained now quickly sweat out. The sun falls over the horizon and disappears, revealing a swirl of stars-that-are-not. I follow a surefire gradient, a path only I would take, ripping the indifferent flowers from their stalks, reveling sickly in the idea that wanton destruction might mark me as human until sunrise. <i>{{Mona Xu, Mona Xu,}}</i> I keep muttering, but it’s a lie, a waste of breath. {{<i>I am human I am here and what would a human being do, what could I do now that a scarecrow or the wind couldn’t</i>.}} It’s no use. As the last light disappears over the horizon, the sunflowers begin to close. Unobserved, I feel myself slipping away into the breeze. My existence rests on the tensile strength of quantum foam.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am nowhere, I am everywhere, in this infinite, idealized night. I am wind over the heads of the flowers and the dirt that feeds their roots. A null assertion of self, free of identity or desire, the color of nothing. Even that nullity competes with others, other non-faces stalking the flowers unseen — dozens of them, maybe...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">{{She’s just trying to help,}} comes a swirl around me. Not with recognition, but with a sweet, ambient puff of acknowledgement. Another face briefly seen from down in the dirt, inviting me to conjure a name. <i>Min? Is that Min?</i> But the Min-thing floats away, only ever a thin smile and a whisper: {{The next time you see her, be kind.}}</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Utter absence forever. I am formless. And yet still, impossibly, I am here.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And then the sun begins to rise in the east.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The sunflowers are all wrong. I only ever notice myself through their lazy gaze. And that is a shattered thing now, their network of roots torn to shards. I see myself peeled off the ground, throat parched, back throbbing. But the unity of the image cannot hold. I move as a multitude, a scattered stumbling in all directions, as though between shards broken and tarnished glass. I feel pushed back by the boundaries of the root systems, struggling to push myself between them, trapped in isolated little knots, lurching forward in what is revealed as an endless loop. I reach for other-Monas and they reach out in reflected turn, but nothing can bridge the gaps between the patches of sunflowers, all seeing me from disconcerted, disconnected angles. I am a shattered thing...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">{{Do you see what we deal with?}} The Deng-thing is all around me, its cruel features smeared across sun-kissed islands of sight. Even the breeze through the crosseyed flowers is all wrong, discontinuous eddies and swirls. {{Do you see what her cowardice did? Do you see what she left me to fix?}}</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It tilts its many chins back towards the sun — which is not a sun. No sun would have such staggering, paralyzing patters running across its surface. No sun could compel the flowers to reach for me now with their clawing, beady, gnarled sightlines, isolating me, gagging me, pinning my <i>tilespace</i> — and the concept comes with a churning shift in perspective. I can’t move my limbs because I have no limbs. I have no eyes, no head in here. I am everywhere, the sand and the sunflowers and the sky. Realization, elation: I reach for the hard circuitry at the edge of my awareness, grasping for the emergency shutdown. But at my periphery I find only more sand, more sunflowers, tessellating far beyond my grasp. I am a neikonaut, I am in loop-lock, but I don’t think I’m in a UTMS scanner. Something is wrong.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then: another nearly formless figure, reaching a hand through the bulge in the tiles. The Deng-thing reacts, but this convexity reacts faster — it’s all familiar, the sweat on its palm, the chokingly ill-advised lavender of its cologne, the infrasonic pulse of the dance floor under my feet — and now Tethi jerks on my shoulder with conjured loops of radiant violet, a familiar and selfsame wave of pure relief —</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">{{You’re holding on,}} he shouts, and yanks me out of loop-lock. {{Let go.}}</span></p>
