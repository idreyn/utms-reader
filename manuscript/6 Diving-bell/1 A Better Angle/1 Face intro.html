<p class="p1"><i>Imagine you’re Dr. Rui Zhang,</i> insist the tiles, too forcefully to be considered an invitation. So I try.</p>
<p class="p1">Imagine what it’s like to own fifteen sweater vests. Imagine what it’s like to be that tall. Hot-and-cold, hide-and-seek: the tiles reward me when I imagine right, and scold me when I imagine wrong, but mostly I ride a lukewarm wave of Rui’s surface details. Of course I don’t really know the man. He’s always been a puttering presence in the background of the Neikotic Safety department, shaking down the vending machines for Pocari Sweat.</p>
<p class="p1">But suddenly he has a lot to tell me, more than he has time to explain in person. <i>Imagine it’s your job to go to work each morning and carefully, thoughtfully, believe the impossible. </i>The reward function swoops like a thrill ride here. <i>Don’t believe it too much, or it’ll send you into the Chalk, even you. And don’t believe it in the wrong way — in fact, don’t believe it in any particular way — because that’s what it wants. It wants a groove to lock into, a mechanism to be explained by, a way to be made mundane. And you are a bulwark, a relief valve, a runaway truck ramp. You take the blow and soften it for others. </i>This is where I’m supposed to bite.</p>
<p class="p1">Okay, Dr. Rui. What is this impossible thing that so burdens you to believe it?</p>
<p class="p1">The Face can really only shuffle around the places and faces that I already know, playing my own memory like a puppet show. Most of Rui’s memory feels like being nobody in the middle of nowhere. <i>But there will be something </i>— I pucker my cheeks, very aware of them at this low dose — <i>there.</i> It hooks, focuses, narrows. <i>Right there.</i> The juiciest overlap between his life and mine. Brace for the yo-yo disorientation when I make eye contact with each other — but no, there’s something weird about this one. I can see Dr. Rui, but he can’t see me. I’m crouched behind a pillar, watching him and Deng converse. I’m being very quiet and very still.</p>
