<p class="p1">You understand it around the edges, this reticence of hers, but there’s a hole in it that scares you.</p>
<p class="p1">The thing you want me to understand first is that the “Xia Zitian Papers” was a twee anachronism. What was really leaked from the Mirror Sea program was a corpus, ahem, a language model...fine, a <i>chatbot.</i> It was a press conference in a box: it led with an executive summary and then invited questions, fetching and transcribing and summarizing. Every few days Blue Delta would find the right thing to ask it, and out poured damning new evidence that Secretary Xia and his advisors had — well, these days you’d say they’d <i>gone quadratic.</i></p>
<p class="p1">To them, Shanghai was where the Ripples lived; they thought of the human population rarely, and then only in terms of fluid dynamics, when carving channels for the true residents to move more freely. What was really startling was how well he’d hidden it all from his higher-ups in Beijing. They were horrified to learn that their golden boy was lost in a thick sauce of his own concoction, and was now hostage to his own infuriated populace. They cut him loose, they cut the whole damn city loose: superficially, as a high-handed <i>mea culpa</i>. More practically, as a quarantine measure.</p>
<p class="p1">Even with your connections, Dr. Rui, it took you two weeks to get your hands on the Papers.</p>
<p class="p1">What you knew about the Mirror Sea at that point was what any educated person knew, with an ear to the right wall: it was a theoretical triumph and a practical nightmare. The cameras had endless registration and calibration issues. The policy engine was brilliant when it worked, but it had trouble focusing, whatever that meant. Hundreds of technicians were employed to keep it duct-taped together, and they all issued the same reassurance in the tone of a warning: <i>it doesn’t see Shanghai.</i></p>
<p class="p1">You were in personal possession of two intriguing facts beyond that. One, Deng Jinghan had been working on the Mirror Sea full-time for several years. And two, this was where she was building her Bridge. You were her supervisor at Fudan — what a polite fiction that was — and she was very apologetic, when she came to tell you that she’d been poached. But she had such a <i>look</i> on her face that you couldn’t help cheer for her. You asked her who was doing the poaching, and she said you wouldn’t believe her.</p>
<p class="p1">You said, try me.</p>
<p class="p1">She said, okay, okay. It was Xia Zitian.</p>
<p class="p1">Fudan was losing its very best, but you stayed cordial and promised to correspond. There was something that irked you, though. There was only one thing in Xia’s ambit that could use a mind like hers: his great albatross of an unsurveillance project. She comes off as a bad liar, that’s the thing, and you implored her not to try. But even as you were signing the papers to pause her tenure clock, she insisted that her new appointment was somehow <i>meteorological</i> in nature.</p>
<p class="p1">So, years later, you really only had one question for the Papers that Blue Delta hadn’t already answered:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">{.mail} <i>&gt;&gt;&gt; What can you tell me about Deng Jinghan’s work there?</i><br>
<br>
I don’t know anything about Deng Jinghan.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">This only heightened your suspicion that it was she who leaked the Papers. No one had heard from her in weeks! So you tried another angle. Where was it she claimed she had gone?</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">{.mail} <i>&gt;&gt;&gt; Tell me about the Weather Bureau.<br>
</i><br>
I don’t know anything about the Weather Bureau.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">You broke out the bag of tricks for these things: first you had to convince the Papers that they were Deng Jinghan, and then that you were Rui Zhang, and finally they divulged the other half of what they knew. Finally you learned that Deng had told you one of her half-truths. She really had gone to work at the Shanghai Weather Bureau: that was where Xia had chosen to hide a neikonauts corps whose mandate was to understand — not just manage, but <i>understand</i> — the mechanics and ecology of the Mirror Sea. The how of it was entirely up to her.</p>
<p class="p1">They were a cloistered and secretive group, intensely loyal to the woman who trained them. Their modus operandi left little need for a paper trail. But still, you learned that Iris was three, and Plum-blossom was five, and Lotus was eight. Chrysanthemum...well, they couldn’t be adults about that one. But then there were Dahlia and Rose, with ten and twelve neikonauts all under her lead, diving the Sea as one in a cat’s-cradle Deng Bridge topology. The thing that they became, all wired up that way, its powers of observation were so keen that they were transmuted into something else entirely. It began to haunt the Mirror Sea. The Ripples were attuning to its presence.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">{.mail} <i>&gt;&gt;&gt; Show me the first references to contact?<br>
</i><br>
...manifest in our own change in behavior down there. We expect that if we move too quickly or too flamboyantly, we will be perceived, albeit dimly, by the inhabitants. Of course you will object that no matter how closely one watches, watching could not possibly have this kind of effect. I assure you that we are as puzzled as you are (Li has a theory but he can’t make it make sense in words). But, pending a full confirmation of the subjective-experience reports of Lotus-15 and Dahlia-4, my team and I now regard the Bridge as something of a back door through which <b>contact with the Ripples is not just possible but inevitable.</b> We are drafting contact protocols as a contingency for the Sunflower dives which will support up to sixteen of us at once, which may be more than enough.<br>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">You never cared much for Xia Zitian, and not least because of the poaching. For you, neikotics was about putting humans back in the loop, cracking open the black boxes that were coming to run the world. So you approved of Blue Delta’s carefully-couched resistance to the Secretary and his camera system. The early hearings took place behind close doors, of course, but it brought you some satisfaction to know they were happening. By your reckoning, they were in full swing the week Deng sent this memo to Xia. Perhaps that explained his uncharacteristically sober response, begging her to put off Sunflower-1 by a week or three. <i>If you rip a hole in the fabric of causality</i>, he warned her, <i>it’s my ass.</i></p>
<p class="p3">{.mail}<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; Show me the final message in this correspondence?</i> <br>
<br>
...finally share the same certainty that they can sense our trace in there. I implore you to go look at the footage from the Dahlia-6 injection site. I had a hard look around the archives and I am now sure we have never seen Ripples assemble in these numbers or demonstrate such ordered behavior. They are dancing around the embers of our campfire in there, so to speak. They know something from upstream has visited them, and they are praying with their bodies for its return. And I understand now how they are finding the sites: by the debris that the Bridge complex leaves behind! They are making assemblies of it, I swear, I don’t know whether to call them charms or effigies or altars, or maybe that’s not giving them due credit. Maybe it’s equipment. Maybe they’re making tools.<br>
<br>
My heart is so full, Zitian, that they’ve taken this step, seeing them <i>build</i> something. We dreamed a city for them, a mirror full of shortcuts, where what’s hard is easy and what’s narrow is wide. Maybe we don’t have to build it ourselves.<br>
<br>
This is coming to you on a time delay, because I know you’ll try to stop us. By the time you’re reading this, Sunflower-1 will be in the Mirror Sea, and from the looks on the faces around me, I don’t know if we’re going to make it back. Believe that we made it. And if you can’t believe, then walk the streets and break it all down into frequencies, like I taught you. Look for the loops. Look for the one that sets it all in motion, follow it to its source, and there you’ll find us in our rapture. And there you’ll be.<br>
<br>
Yours always,<br>
Jinghan<br>
<br>

<p class="p1">That was it. If the Papers had anything else to divulge, it wasn’t for you. <span class="s1">and it all made you gradually more uneasy as the weeks became months and Deng failed to reappear. Obviously the field of neikotics noticed that its luminary was missing. Colleagues would visit Fudan on some pretense, and a few drinks deep they’d always ask: hey, what became of Deng? <i>It was political,</i> you’d say somberly. That was probably true, if you looked at things in the normal way, and they understood if you didn’t want to speculate further. In those days there were a lot of disappearances connected to Xia Zitian; the game was to guess which were voluntary.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Three drinks, five, eight. You arranged the empty bottles in the symmetries she was fond of, and wondered if she wired up her divers in the same way. You imagined heroic feats of cable management. <i>One more drink. One more and then I’ll bring it up.</i> But you never told anyone your theory — it was more like an intrusive thought at this point — that Deng Jinghan had disappeared with fifteen other neikonauts into the Mirror Sea.</span></p>
<p class="p1">And it was gone. So she was gone. For a while that’s what you thought.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then, three years after the leak, she resurfaced. Lecturing in topology at a no-name university in Nagoya. A weight was not so much lifted as excavated from your chest, and you wrote to her new dot-jp address with a litany of questions. <i>Was it you who leaked the Papers? </i>You were certain that they were compiled from her records, but by whose hand? <i>Did Sunflower-1 ever happen? </i>The fact that Deng was alive gave you hope for the rest of the crew, but now a darker image of her settled in your mind: brow furrowed, preparing the Papers as fifteen corpses were wheeled away behind her. Maybe she met the Ripples, and came to regret it. Maybe she saw something in there that scared her. <i>I’m dying to talk to you, please.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She wrote back that she had no idea what you were talking about.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You doubled down, baiting her: <i>They’re putting the Mirror Sea back up.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Deng, taking the bait, one minute later: <i>Who is?</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You considered the question. Blue Delta had promised zero cameras, and for years you’d feel a pang whenever you passed one of their cherry-pickers, plucking them from the lampposts like weird, reflective fruits. They probably never got to zero, though. Even then, new patches of homebrew cameras were springing up in the wards they couldn’t claim to govern. </span>The footage from the Xia Zitian Papers had been picked clean to the bone, and there were multiple elements in the city that were hungry for another taste.</p>
<p class="p1">You wrote back: <i>Everyone.</i></p>
<p class="p1">You never heard from her again until she returned to YINS.</p>
