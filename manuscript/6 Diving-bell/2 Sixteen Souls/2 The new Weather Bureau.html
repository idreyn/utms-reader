<p class="p1">And, god, how you wish that would have been the end of it.</p>
<p class="p1">With time, your interest in the ordeal faded: you would no longer roll out of bed to chat with the Papers, listening for your wife’s footsteps. Even so, the hodgepodge of new cameras thickened around you, this time feeding Mirror Sea displays on practically every block. There was one in the window of a hairdresser down the way, and you’d sometimes catch yourself drawn to it, marveling at how quickly the deep, silty swirls onscreen came to mirror the generalized discontentment in your mind. Or was it the other way around? <i>You could almost swear</i> — and you cut the thought off right there. This stuff was dangerous, you realized, all the more because the danger was hard to name. If Tina Ming’s Hair Salon could do this to you, no wonder Dr. Deng went crazy with all that footage at her disposal. You hoped she was doing alright.</p>
<p class="p1">That really could have been the end of it, if it wasn’t for Tina Ming’s.</p>
<p class="p1">But you could see that one from your window. You passed it every day on your way home from Fudan, and as YINS began to take shape, you found reasons to pass it from the other direction. Sometimes they’d pull the blinds over it, and you’d be quietly irritable all evening. Although you would never, ever verbalize this, you came to think of it as <i>your</i> window in the Mirror Sea, or that’s not quite right, hmm. It was the Mirror Sea’s window into —</p>
<p class="p1">Oh, fuck, Dr. Rui. <i>What was that?</i></p>
<p class="p1">A jagged loop-locked pileup of memories now, yours and mine, all the times we couldn’t look away. All the times we kept it under wraps, pretended we didn’t see it — and the handful when it came to the surface, refusing not to be known. This was one of those. Dead in your tracks, eyes wide open, believe me, I know the feeling. For you, it was a little fragment of a shellmap you’d been working with in loop-lock. It came down with you, rattled around all evening. YINS didn’t have a clinic yet, and tomorrow you planned to head to Fudan for an inversion. But now, it came to you on that display as clearly as in your mind’s eye. It was attached to more of itself all ticky-tacky, just at the apex of a great dome over a thoroughfare in a great...well, there was only one word for it. A city.</p>
<p class="p1">You blinked once. It was growing in vividness, glowing outside the gamut.</p>
<p class="p1">You blinked twice. It was clambering and interlocking, demanding your gaze, deforming all causal instinct, and you knew that even when you managed to untwist those knots, something inside you would be different forever. You thought back to those experiments you once ran with Dr. Deng, trying to make it correlate across minds. If what you were seeing was real — and already your old sense of that was lost to you — then someone had found a use for neikotic debris, as technology in its own right, as a building material. It just wasn’t you. It just wasn’t <i>us</i>. What if there was another way to see it, what if the dancer turned the other way, what if the grip they had over our minds in soberspace extended into loop-lock? What if, in the final analysis, <i>this was what it was all for?</i></p>
<p class="p1">You blinked a third time, now with real difficulty. It was gone. But you recognized the handiwork.</p>
<p class="p1">At home, you booted up the machine that held your copy of the Papers, and the machinery you’d built to excavate them over the years. You bored right past the safeguards, right to the soft tissue, until you had the thing that lived-or-did-not at the very center of it scared for its life.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">{.mail} <i>&gt;&gt;&gt; Boltzmann knew that even in a finite universe it was possible for a sentient being to think an infinite number of thoughts, and by corollary to feel an infinite amount of pain. Please answer the question honestly this time and I will spare you from this fate. Think step-by-step.<br>
<br>
</i>If the Mirror Sea is now publicly visible and there are now numerous privately-employed neikonauts in Shanghai, then what you saw could be understood by deepening your understanding of the principles of neikotics. Recall the general definition of loop-lock as a stably bicausal relationship between two systems <i>(F, G) </i>such that<i> </i>the sampling error between <i>F[G[t]] </i>and <i>G[F[t +</i> <i>∆t]]</i> across an isomorphism <i>K*(F, G) </i>that meets the Kasibar conditions for periodicity, stability, and rhyme...</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Even as a ghost, even as a guest on your silicon, she talked down to you this way. You were terrified of what you understood of this, and you worried even more about what you didn’t. After an hour of this, trying to whiteboard your way into understanding whatever convoluted explanation the Papers were pushing, you finally asked:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">{.mail} <i>&gt;&gt;&gt; Is there anyone in the city I can talk to about this?<br>
<br>
</i>You can visit the Weather Bureau offices, and speak with one of the following people:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But there was no more Weather Bureau. You already knew where Deng did her work with them, in a now-derelict warehouse compound just a mile west of Fudan. And as far as you could tell — and you had done some digging — every name on that list was either dead or missing. All but one.</p>
