<p class="p1">Xia Zitian’s whereabouts were hardly a secret. Blue Delta had subjected him to one show trial after another, and for a while they had him back in the hot seat weekly, sobering up in the bright lights of City Hall. But their position was too tenuous, their own flailing attempts to govern were proving unpopular, and none of the municipal bigwigs on the bench had a leash on the law of the land. Hearings were drawn out and postponed, and Xia’s house arrest became a permanent affair. In political cartoons, he always appeared with an ankle bracelet. On late-night sketch shows, he’d send his handlers down to the corner store for his favorite instant noodles, and they’d return years later in black robes and face paint, unaware that years had passed. According to the paparazzi, he got his fresh air at night.</p>
<p class="p1">So that’s where you went, and that’s when you went. Towers had gone up around the stately house he still lived in; half-past midnight, their facades shone the Mirror Sea back into his face. You had no better plan than to ring him at the gate, but you were stopped by a bluelight on guard duty, a man as tall as you and twice as wide, who looked like he’d been a few years away from retirement for a very long time. He took a flashlight to your YZID, which was just cardstock back then. You got a patdown for your trouble.</p>
<p class="p1">“Tell him I need to speak with him. Tell him it’s about the Mirror Sea.”</p>
<p class="p1">The bluelight, whose name was Ma Zhuming, laughed in your face. “I’ll see if I can slot you in,” he said, marching you back to the corner.</p>
<p class="p1">“No, wait...” You stumbled over your words. You didn’t want to spend the night in jail, especially not before you got that inversion. You still had debris in you, and now you were terrified that, what, the Ripples were watching through your eyes? “I’m a professor of neikotics. I knew Dr. Deng Jinghan. It’s about the Weather Bureau.”</p>
<p class="p1">The bluelight said nothing, but his ruddy face went ghostly white. And as he hustled away without another word, you saw a cigarette flare on the back porch.</p>
<p class="p1">Six days later, Captain Ma Zhuming came to your new office at YINS, at a comparably late hour. You figured he was going to draw a gun or a badge, but when he reached into his pocket it was only to retrieve a toothpick.</p>
<p class="p1">“You worked with her,” Ma said, gnawingly.</p>
<p class="p1">“I worked with her,” you confirmed, your voice tentative, settling back into your chair.</p>
<p class="p1">“I did too,” he sighed. He cast his great overcoat over one of your expensive glass vases. “A goddamn piece of work, wasn’t she?”</p>
<p class="p1">Ma Zhuming was what you were looking for. He was your loose end, and you were his. He was an old friend of the Secretary’s, a buddy from his Navy days, his fixer in the middle ranks of the old <i>chengguan</i>. He’d been in and out of the old Weather Bureau building when Xia himself could not be, doing the work that a close-knit group of neikonauts would surely ignore: making sure the plants were watered, the kitchenette was stocked, and the toilets were clean. He filled a hole in the hole in the Xia Zitian Papers: for all her meticulous note-taking, Dr. Deng had never seen fit to mention him. The Papers had caught him by surprise, too. One day he woke up and discovered that his old friend was out of a job.</p>
<p class="p1">“So then you know,” you insisted, gripping your chair. “You know what happened with Sunflower.”</p>
<p class="p1">Ma shook his head, but even that came with a wash of enormous relief. You always wondered whether the whole thing was a hallucination that the Papers produced in response to your endless needling; this was your first confirmation that any of it had really happened. “The Secretary tried to convince her to take it slow,” he told you. “He didn’t think we were ready to make contact with the Ripples, and he wanted to do it on his terms. Between you and me, I think he wanted to do it himself. Until tonight —” and here he stopped for a heaving sigh.</p>
<p class="p1">Until tonight, he told you, he’d never been sure that Deng ever went through with it. He told you that the night she sent her last message about Sunflower-1, he and Xia arrived at the Weather Bureau facility to find it deserted. There was evidence of a struggle; the network of interlinked Deng Bridges was in pieces, compromised to a permanent end. And in exchange, voice wavering, you finally gave voice to your suspicions. It was doubly difficult to explain to a layperson; you thought you sounded insane, saying that you were increasingly certain Deng and her crew had disappeared into the Mirror Sea, and part of them was still in there, teaching the Ripples how to build. Even though the cameras had come down and gone back up, somehow, there they were.</p>
<p class="p1">They were just cameras, after all. They only saw what was already there.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">You were shaking, sweaty, almost sobbing by the end of it. But Ma just nodded grimly and went for another toothpick. “He’s going to want to meet you,” the bluelight said. “The Secretary, I mean. It won’t be right away. Even if he could leave that great fancy tomb of his, I don’t think he’d want to anymore. He’s scared of his own shadow.”</p>
<p class="p1">“What —” you began, but you weren’t so sure what the question was. “I mean, okay. I can do that. I can tell him all this. If you think that will help.”</p>
<p class="p1">“If I think it will <i>help?</i>” Ma barked with laughter. “You’re not the only one who sees what’s going on out there. Blue Delta can’t keep it under control, and I don’t think they want to anymore. If they try to tear down the Mirror Sea a second time, that’s the nail in their coffin. That’s just about the only thing the city agrees on, these days.”</p>
<p class="p1">“You’re saying —”</p>
<p class="p1">“I’m saying that <i>someone’s</i> got to take responsibility for it. That’s how the Secretary sees it.”</p>
<p class="p1">“You’re saying —”</p>
<p class="p1">“I’m saying that you and I could be that someone. If you like.” His hand shot a little too quickly across the table, outstretched in offer, but not exactly. Already any sense of choice was slipping away. “Professor, have you noticed that in all these years, nobody has been reporting the weather?”</p>
