<p class="p1">The thing you are fighting is impossible, or very nearly so, and so you call it Epsilon City.</p>
<p class="p1">And it was you, Dr. Rui, who picked through the charred remains of Deng’s work, who wrote the protocols for safely observing Epsilon City from loop-lock. A thick manual of linearization exercises, the many rounds of broad-spectrum inversions that your new, reconstituted Weather Bureau’s neikonauts must submit to afterwards, all to keep a certain kind of runaway curiosity from breeding within your walls. Is the cure worse than the disease? Sometimes you think so, but someone has to hold the line. After all, you’re not the only ones who know where to find it.</p>
