<p class="p1">An inversion.</p>
<p class="p1">And in loop-lock I remember suddenly and clearly how it felt to come upon Tenfold Gate debris in another’s mind. How it was pernicious, wart-like, with no clear boundary. How I found a spot of laggard and uncooperative tiles, and how I followed it with growing horror towards a shock of something like orange-red fungus, striated and deeply grooved, laced against no earthly blueprint through my patient’s soul. Its core was chitinous, unyielding, and strangely fiber-optic. It had an opaque and plasticine datacenter hum. It left me with the uneasy feeling that — not to put too fine a point on it — something alien was colonizing the tilespace, running warm and primordial logicks beneath its gourd-hull. In soberspace, between loop-lock sessions, it grew slowly and thoughtfully: folding up against itself, taking inches, never giving them back. And it was not painful, not unless you tried to pick at it, peel it off. Not until it outgrew the nooks and crannies. Not until it was.</p>
<p class="p1">It was a monoculture, and that’s why I made myself an ecosystem.</p>
<p class="p1">I remember again how in the moment of inversion, I didn’t strike, or rip, or unwind. Inside my patient’s mind, I came upon Tenfold Gate as dishwater, as fishwater, with a surfactant patience: <i>let it soak.</i> I grew around it, in ersatz purples and yellows and oranges, in smokestacks and fans. I brought the jellies and the flatworms and turtles, and gave the rigid folds of debris new purpose as a harbor. <i>Let it soak.</i> I gave it new grooves to grow into, new niches to fill. I changed its surroundings so gradually that it never noticed when it became a symbiote, utterly dependent on its context. <i>Let it soak. </i>And in the moment of inversion, I ripped that context away, and Tenfold Gate went down the memory hole with the rest of the reef. Coming down from loop-lock, I was briefly proud of how I went about that.</p>
<p class="p1">All those details were flushed and forgotten by the time I sat up in the scanner bed.</p>
<p class="p1">“You should be careful,” I whispered to Cai Yuhui. I felt triumphant, and warm all over. <i>She, </i>of all people,<i> </i>had been my patient, and the relief on her face was my new drug. “I don’t know if I’ll be able to do that again.”</p>
