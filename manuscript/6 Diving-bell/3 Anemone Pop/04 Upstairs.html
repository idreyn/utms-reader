<p class="p1">The tiles heave and shutter, but they manage to stitch my memory to yours, to the same week in April, to the very same night. Across campus, you pace the higher floors of Building 6. There were calm stretches where you never had to come up here, where the Weather Bureau receded deep into the texture of YINS, where the fiction of the Observatory almost became fact. Those are becoming gradually rarer. But the Bureau’s crisis command center occupies a mechanical floor, chilly concrete and bare I-beams and high ceilings — at least up here, you can really <i>pace.</i></p>
<p class="p1">“<i>There’s an inversion!</i>” Cai shouts, wheeling into the room. “A real inversion! I’m free of the debris!”</p>
<p class="p1">Heads turn jealously, as they tend to do, towards Cai Yuhui. Her relief from Tenfold Gate is palpable, but it is unfortunately not yet contagious. Every neikonaut in the city wants what she has.</p>
<p class="p1">“Slow down,” you tell her, though she is already laid out on a couch. “Who found it? What was it?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Mona Xu,” she mutters, eyes half-closed. Tenfold Gate has denied her too many REM cycles. “The Bridge.”</p>
<p class="p1">You toss a blanket over her and call Captain Ma with the news. If this is a solution to the Tenfold Gate crisis, it is a delicate one. You don’t really have the inversion, not yet, but knowing that one is possible keeps you working through the night in a way the pills can no longer manage. You’ll need to fashion a kind of soberware glue-trap, and send Cai back down to the clinic at least two, three more times to sample the inversion. You’ll need to get Mona Xu to repeat the process. This would be much easier with Dr. Deng’s blessing. But as it stands, she can’t suspect a thing.</p>
