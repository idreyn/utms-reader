<p class="p1">You send Cai back to me a total of ten times. You would’ve liked to get it in one take, but your soberware glue-traps, let’s face it, Rui Zhang — they don’t work very well. Cai returns to the Observatory after each of our sessions so your techs can peel her mind apart, looking for soft imprints and gentle aftertastes of my Tenfold Gate inversion. Its interior clockwork begins to subtly modify her behavior, her expressions, her patterns of speech. For a desperate, flailing gamble, this is all working remarkably well. By the sixth of ten sessions, you can look at her manifolds and see wriggling traces of my inversion with the naked eye. <i>It looks a little bit like coral, </i>one of your technicians decides.</p>
<p class="p1">The codename <i>Anemone Pop </i>is floated the same day.</p>
<p class="p1">When they learn what they have to work with, the Bureau’s memeticists roll their eyes and tug their turtlenecks and muss up their squared-off bangs in frustration. <i>The entire city is a great coral reef? </i>It’s all a little on the nose, no? The Ripplechasing community burned out on ocean motifs five or six years ago — you do know that, right? It would be several years premature to go ironic, or retro, or ironically retro with this. You can’t force these things, Dr. Rui. There’s no way they’re going to pick this up. We all agree that these are the patterns that have to go in front of the cameras. But you’ve got to find another angle.</p>
<p class="p1">You shrug. You have Cai Yuhui on your side.</p>
