<p class="p1">It never becomes clear to you which of the Big Three actually discovered the Tenfold Gate egg in the Mirror Sea. Suowei has the largest observatory, but Paracoin’s cameras are all in the right places. You don’t think it was Chaoyue. It’s never Chaoyue. Even so, each of them claims credit for the algorithm, once it leaks to the public, once the egg — a red-orange, angular, and internally reflective thing — has a street value barely exceeding the voxelite it’s printed with. But when Ma Zhuming sends the Bureau’s visored goons to their offices, they all claim to have found it through corporate espionage. <i>Go talk to Chaoyue.</i> They’d scribble down the WeChat IDs of their nemeses at the other firms. <i>Go talk to Suowei.</i></p>
<p class="p1">You don’t press the issue. The private observatories think of the Mirror Sea as a kind of extended thinking aid, not the real home of a sapient civilization, and it’s of paramount importance that you don’t give them a reason to look more closely. The more the Weather Bureau insists that the Mirror Sea is dangerous, the closer Shanghai insists on looking. You cannot let the public think: <i>they’re hiding something. </i>You cannot let the public ask: <i>what don’t they want us to see?</i> This is the Bureau’s operating principle. You must be extraordinarily strategic in throwing your weight around. You must wriggle backwards out of all your jams. You, Rui Zhang, suspect this will continue to work until, one day, it doesn’t.</p>
<p class="p1">You worry that day is coming fast.</p>
