<p class="p1">The more you look, the more you see it: Tenfold Gate debris in the Mirror Sea. As it builds up in the minds of neikonauts, it appears, just as rigid and unyielding, as rufous trim on the Sea’s caverns and ravines. In this sense, you are lucky: most people are interested in the churn of the Sea, where the Ripples thrive, and not its background stillnesses. But there are geologists everywhere. There is a kid inside all of us who loves to be shown a cool rock. And there are people on the message boards who are paying attention to these structures, trying to mine them for meaning. They are calling them <i>hyperlagmites. </i>You understand that there must be a mechanism by which the Tenfold Gate in our minds closes the loop somehow, and alters the glass-drip rhythms of Shanghai’s stillnesses to produce these formations on the other end of the lens. <i>You do not want to know what that mechanism is. </i>So on a scrap of paper you write out three rules:</p>
<p class="p1">1. Do not draw attention away from the hyperlagmites. This will backfire.</p>
<p class="p1">2. Do not attempt to explain them. Do not give them a way to be rational or mundane.</p>
<p class="p1">3. Do not, under any circumstances, wonder what the hyperlagmites are <i>for</i>.</p>
<p class="p1">Following these rules does not come naturally, not to a mind like yours, which is prone to the thing which is both panic and understanding. That’s why you lay them out in shorthand: Rules One, Two, and Three. You understand that the key to neikotic inversion is a logic of disinterest, a battle for frame. You try very hard not to think about how Tenfold Gate is already creeping directly between minds, easing Shanghai by warp and weft into the sensation that the Mirror Sea is already<i> </i>here, a simpler world haunting the epicycles of this one: ready to be remembered-again, to be annealed-into, to be inhabited-instead. <i>Do not think about this.</i> Do not pay any attention to the lurking shadow of Epsilon City, and its latest heaving foray into soberspace. Think about how Cai and her teams are out there every night, seeding the inversion on the streets with their coral and scales.</p>
