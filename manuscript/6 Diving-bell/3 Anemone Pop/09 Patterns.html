<p class="p1">No one can tease a pattern from the noise like Cai Yuhui, and within a week Anemone Pop is the biggest thing in the Mirror Sea. It shows up everywhere, in broad daylight and the dead of night. There’s music about it, art about it, crime about it. By now flashes of Epsilon City are plainly visible on the displays, but they blend perfectly into what Cai has made of my own inversion, a carnival in the shallows, a languid and gaudy insistence that <i>it’s not that deep.</i> Even with feeds from a full quarter of the city’s cameras, your Sea-Watch team has absolutely no idea where its center is. You don’t feel even remotely in control of it. But nothing of that size can sustain itself in the Sea. It’s going to crash eventually. All Cai has to do is make sure it crashes into the right thing.</p>
<p class="p1">But still — you don’t breathe a sigh of relief until the night you step onto the YINS quad, and you feel it in your own body: <i>The entire city is a great coral reef. </i>You walk Beiwan Ward and you see it on the displays, in purple and orange and yellow: <i>The entire city is a great coral reef.</i> For the first time in weeks, you feel something in the air besides the rigid paranoia of a campus under duress, something wild and liquid and free. <i>The entire city is a great coral reef.</i></p>
<p class="p1">You’re going to do it. And you allow yourself a moment of triumph. You’re sending the Tenfold Gate inversion back where Tenfold Gate came from, and even though you’re not a violent man, you let your blood run red for a few breaths, and savor the image of your vengeance raining upon Epsilon City. You can’t wait to rip those pieces from your voxelite model. You curl your fists and spit right on one of the Mirror Sea displays: <i>now who’s causally downstream of who?</i> You glance around; you hope nobody saw that.</p>
<p class="p1">You’re going to do it. Well, <i>Cai’s</i> going to do it. She’ll buy you, what, six months? Twelve?</p>
<p class="p1">Time enough to get Dr. Deng on your side, if you’re luckier than you have been.</p>
