<p class="p1">You’re not.</p>
<p class="p1">Imagine a light mist on a late April day, a damp that you can’t get out of your clothes, something phlegmy taking residence in your throat. Every minute or so, you crane your neck down the street: the primer tiles on the windows of Building 1 are doing something soft and snowy in the low fog. Even in the petri-dish isolate of Beiwan Ward, you can tell the city is quieter than usual. Something has died here.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s always when you give up on Deng that she finally arrives; so for a while, you don’t. You keep your own company, checking your fussy platinum wanji at regular intervals, sipping from a paper cup. You watch the Weather Bureau hand the scene off to the bluelights and the fire patrol, then pile into their nondescript and bulky veetles and disappear into the fog. You don’t recognize any of the men and women behind those visors, and they don’t recognize you. Very few people understand what YINS is to the Bureau, or the Bureau is to YINS. You’re lucky you don’t usually have to explain it.</p>
<p class="p1">Then you hear her roller bag clattering along the sidewalk.</p>
<p class="p1">“I came as soon as I heard. What happened? Where is she?” As Deng catches her breath, she takes in the damage to the ten-story dorm building at the edge of YINS. It’s far from unsalvageable — it was water, not fire — but the entire tower will need to be gutted, rewired, sprayed for mold. Already they’re carrying out ruined lengths of carpet in waterlogged rolls. “Good lord, Rui, <i>Mona</i> did all this?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Not just her, no. When it died, Anemone Pop had a sizable number of YINS students in its grasp. You can think of this as a funeral rite for the Ripple. It left an enormous hole in the social fabric. It will take time to close.”</p>
<p class="p1">Deng huffs. You know she hates to be confronted with evidence, however indirect, of the Mirror Sea as anything other than pretty pictures on big screens. She hates your cutesy little codenames for the traitorous Ripples you summon from the silt. But you don’t press the issue, because maybe, <i>maybe</i> this time...</p>
<p class="p1">“So is she in some kind of trouble?” Deng takes a seat and begins to bang her shoe on the bench between you, dislodging a small rock. “I mean, with your people? Over this?”</p>
<p class="p1">All morning you’ve been telling yourself that you need to come clean to Deng. And Captain Ma, for once in his whole bull-headed life, he agrees with you. He says that dragging this out will make it exponentially worse — and to you, this sentence conjured an image of Deng in an lecture hall, putting chalk to board, drawing an unpleasant, shrieking curve. You haven’t decided how to broach it. You evade.</p>
<p class="p1">“No. She’s not in trouble.”</p>
<p class="p1">“But you <i>are</i> holding her.”</p>
<p class="p1">“We’re keeping her at a facility off campus for a few days of monitoring.” This displeases Deng, so you run your mouth, let too much slip. “We’re giving her the in-house linearization protocol and as gentle a comedown as we know how to manage. For all intents and purposes, we’re treating her like a member of Weather Bureau staff.”</p>
<p class="p1">Her eyes narrow. “Why?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Usually you’d tell me you don’t want to know.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Usually you don’t have my student in your custody.”</p>
<p class="p1">Your mouth opens. And this next part, it never quite got remembered correctly. You must have suppressed whatever it is Deng shouts at you, when you admit that <i>I</i>, Mona, unwittingly provided your latest weapon against Epsilon City. Mostly you register an acute fear of the bottom part of her right shoe, and I feel my tilespace ringing. When the memory recoheres, you’ve moved down the street. People are staring.</p>
<p class="p1">“So you sent Cai Yuhui to her for an inversion. Ten times. You <i>knew</i> that Mona would use the Bridge.”</p>
<p class="p1">“We hoped. We hoped, is all. She has a real knack for it.”</p>
<p class="p1">“And you, what, you <i>recorded </i>it?”</p>
<p class="p1">You hate how psychotic it sounds, retold from beginning to end. You try believing it at arm’s length, but that’s even worse — because then what has it all been for? It infuriates you, the gentle skepticism on Deng’s face when you explain with a patient frankness that the Ripples are once again building in the Mirror Sea. <i>And who taught them how to do that?</i> You want to shake the answer out of her.</p>
<p class="p1">“The <i>hyperlagmites</i>. Rui, aren’t you making a goddamn movie about the hyperlagmites?”</p>
<p class="p1">“That’s a plant. It’s three hours of nothing. We’re trying to draw oxygen away from it.”</p>
<p class="p1">You wish she’d tip her hand, just once. <i>You’re playing with fire, Rui. You don’t understand the forces you’re interfering with. </i>Something like that. Instead, she slides off the bench. “As usual, none of that makes any sense to me. If you think what people are seeing in the Mirror Sea is actually Tenfold Gate debris, you might want to have your own head checked.”</p>
<p class="p1">And you wonder if you, too, could just walk away.</p>
