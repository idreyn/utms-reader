<p class="p1">I come down alone, and I’m thankful. No one should see me this way.</p>
<p class="p1"><i>I don’t even know what I’m crying about</i> — people usually mean something else when they say that. The Face memory transfer protocol works in the stupidest possible way; Dr. Rui in the flesh warned me that in soberspace I’d forget the specifics of everything it told me, then re-remember them piecemeal over the next few days. He warned me to expect popcorn in my brain. For now, a little quiet, a little darkness, just a little longer, <i>please. </i>I don’t want any specifics. I don’t want to know why I feel this yawning and bottomless sense of betrayal from all sides. This sense of being an invaluable and even irreplaceable instrument, but an instrument all the same, to the people I mistook for the adults in the room. That no one for a thousand miles around values me for anything but what I can compute.</p>
<p class="p1">Except, maybe, generously, one person. <i>And just where are they taking him?</i></p>
<p class="p1">High ceilings, dim track lighting. The wall behind me is just scaffolding around a spheroid curve: the obverse side of the Observatory’s projection screen. One corner of the space is furnished, in the sense that it’s a graveyard for the Weather Bureau’s old dinged-up conference tables and peeling swivel chairs. The rest is long rows of tall black filing cabinets. There is burnt coffee brewing nearby, and when I reach for a mug I realize that I still have the Sunflower-I patch clenched so tightly in my fist that my nails leave marks. <i>Pop</i>.</p>
<p class="p1">Rui’s memory unfolds anew, but I’ve inherited his numbness to it. It doesn’t shock me the way it should. The fact that the current Weather Bureau is the salvaged wreck of something Deng left behind, sworn to contain what she created: it feels as obvious to me as it does to Rui, it comes as mere grime on the windshield. The fact that the Deng Bridge killed sixteen neikonauts chasing an anomaly in the Sea: I <i>want</i> to be horrified, but it’s pre-processed, layered on all wrong, infecting my own memories as though I knew her as a murderer from our first meeting at Stanford. And if I had known — I take my first sip of Bureau coffee here and, <i>bleh</i> — if I <i>had</i> known, would that have made any difference?</p>
<p class="p1">Not in a way I’m proud to admit. If she ever confided in me, I would have been elated. Her secret would have been my prized possession. But more than that, I would have steered clear of Cai Yuhui and the Mirror Sea. <i>Look away while you still can</i>, she might have told me, and I would have listened. But she never broke her studied indifference to it, not even to keep me from drowning. Maybe she knows what she’s doing. Maybe she really no longer believes. Or maybe she’s very, very afraid.</p>
