<p class="p1">When the Weather Bureau finally released me, a year ago in spring, it was with a toothbrush and a towel and a seventy-two hour ward entry token for Xietu South, where they suggested I might find refuge from the Mirror Sea. The rest of my possessions were to be found in a few waterlogged plastic bags outside the dorm building I had just flooded. Only then did the scale of the disaster hit me — I realized that I wasn’t — of <i>course</i> I wasn’t the only one. Dozens of other YINS students had opened their taps, too, overcome by the same wave of blind, psychotic grief.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">But we were instructed not to find each other. To forget and move on. There were faces in the halls that I remembered dearly from those heady weeks, but I never knew them as people, nor they me. We’d been reflective to each other, concave to each other, in a way that names would only have impeded. Afterwards we ignored each other conspicuously. We were jilted ex-lovers staking out the far corners of a new vastness. We were survivors of a private apocalypse, and had nothing but scar tissue in common. Never in my entire life had I felt so alone, and that was saying something.</p>
<p class="p1">The worst of it, though, was the sense that I was still in Bureau custody, still under observation in one of their warrens. I hallucinated uniformed agents at the edges of my vision, in the back of lecture halls, slipping through unmarked doors. I read too much into obscure research posters on the upper floors. I was fairly certain YINS used the same mango-smelling disinfectant as the Bureau’s holding facility. There was this horrid sense that if I took one step out of line, I’d find myself starting awake in one of their scanner beds, not a day removed from my episode. A visored face would peer down, and a re-synthesized voice would tell me: <i>Making progress. Nearly linear. Let’s try that again.</i> Long after the worst aftershocks had passed, I would pause at the threshold of Building 1 — deep breath — and remind myself that here, of all places, I was out of the Weather Bureau’s reach.</p>
<p class="p1">I was wrong. Or rather, I was right. I was fucking right.</p>
