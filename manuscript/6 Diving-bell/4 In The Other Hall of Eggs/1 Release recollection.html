<p class="p1">When the Weather Bureau finally released me, a year ago in spring, it was with a toothbrush and a towel and a seventy-two hour ward entry token for Xietu South, where they suggested I might find refuge from the Mirror Sea. The rest of my possessions were to be found in a few waterlogged plastic bags outside the dorm building I had just flooded. <i>The entire city is a great coral reef</i>, only not anymore: A whole worldway had been ripped too suddenly from my eyes — but then, I learned, not only mine. Dozens of other YINS students had opened their taps, too, overcome by the same wave of blind psychotic grief. The building was structurally damaged, closed indefinitely.</p>
<p class="p1">We were instructed not to find each other. To forget and move on. There were faces in the halls that I remembered dearly from those heady weeks, but I never knew them as people, nor they me. We’d been mutual conduits into an achingly beautiful contortion of the world, shared in silence and glance and gesture, that names would only have impeded. We ignored each other conspicuously, like jilted ex-lovers staking out the far corners of a vast new emptiness. We were survivors of a private apocalypse, and we had nothing but scar tissue in common. Never in my entire life had I felt so alone, and that was saying something.</p>
<p class="p1">The worst of it, though, was the sense that I was still in Bureau custody, still under observation in one of their warrens. I hallucinated uniformed agents at the edges of my vision, in the back of lecture halls, slipping through unmarked doors. I read too much into obscure research posters on the upper floors. I was fairly certain YINS used the same mango-smelling disinfectant as the Bureau’s holding facility. There was this horrid sense that if I took one step out of line, I’d find myself starting awake in one of their scanner beds, not a day removed from my episode, in one of their linearization sessions. A visored face would peer down, and a re-synthesized voice would tell me: <i>Not bad. Making progress. Let’s try that again.</i> Long after the worst aftershocks had passed, I would pause at the threshold of Building 1 — deep breath — and remind myself that here, of all places, I was out of the Weather Bureau’s reach.</p>
<p class="p1">I was wrong. Or rather, I was right. I was fucking right.</p>
