<p class="p1">I come down alone, and I’m thankful. No one should see me this way.</p>
<p class="p1"><i>I don’t even know what I’m crying about</i> — people usually mean something else when they say that. The Face memory transfer protocol works in the stupidest possible way; the real Dr. Rui warned me that in soberspace I’d forget the specifics of everything it told me, then re-remember them piecemeal over the next few days. He warned me to expect popcorn in my brain. For now, a little quiet, a little darkness, just a little longer, <i>please. </i>I don’t want any specifics. I don’t want to know why I feel this yawning and bottomless sense of betrayal from all sides. I understand dimly that I am an invaluable and even irreplaceable instrument, but an instrument all the same, to the people I mistook for the adults in the room. That anyone for a thousand miles around values me only for what I can compute.</p>
<p class="p1">Except, maybe, generously, one person. <i>And just where are they taking him?</i></p>
<p class="p1">High ceilings, dim track lighting. The wall behind me is just scaffolding around a spheroid curve: the backside of the Observatory’s projection screen. One corner of the space is furnished, in the sense that it’s a graveyard for the Weather Bureau’s dinged-up old conference tables and chairs. The rest is long rows of tall black filing cabinets. There is burnt coffee brewing nearby, and when I reach for a mug I realize that I still have the Sunflower-I patch clenched so tightly in my fist that my nails leave marks. <i>Pop</i>.</p>
<p class="p1">Rui’s memory unfolds anew, but I’ve inherited his numbness to it. It doesn’t shock me the way it should. The fact that today’s Weather Bureau is the funhouse mirror of something Deng left behind, sworn to contain what she created: it feels as obvious to me as it does to Rui; it comes as mere grime on the windshield. That the Deng Bridge killed those neikonauts chasing an anomaly in the Sea: I <i>want</i> to be horrified, but it’s pre-processed, layered on all wrong, infecting my own memories as though I knew her as a murderer from our first meeting at Stanford. And if I had known — I take my first sip of Bureau coffee here and, <i>bleh</i> — if I had known, would that have made any difference?</p>
<p class="p1">Not in a way I’m proud to admit. I would have been elated that she confided in me. Her secret would have been my prized possession. But then, here is the difference: I would have steered clear of Cai Yuhui and the Mirror Sea. <i>Look away while you still can</i>, she might have told me, and I would have listened. But she never broke her studied indifference to it, not even to keep me from drowning. Maybe she knows best how to thread this needle. Maybe she really no longer believes. Or maybe she’s very, very afraid.</p>
<p class="p1">The cabinets here have slender, foam-lined drawers. They slide out on silent casters to reveal — well, what else but eggs? Rows and rows of neikotic eggs, each with a discoverer and a date and a hint as to their flavor. Their labels have a fourth row, not seen downstairs in the Hall of Eggs lack: a location, in a variety of haphazard coordinate systems, where the egg was discovered in the Mirror Sea. The early ones are rough-hewn, primitive things. They have whimsical descriptions, little more than brainteasers and koans. <i>Muffled wingbeats; coniferous symmetries; a way to see the same thing twice. </i>But top to bottom, left to right, they take on gradually useful qualities. Cai’s name begins to appear on the labels. I recognize some of these from textbooks. I recognize Tenfold Gate. <i>Pop.</i></p>
<p class="p1">And beyond the cabinets, something else. Dangling from countless gossamer strands, just above eye level and gently floodlit from below, the Ripples’ hidden metropolis is halfway reconstructed from thousands — perhaps a million — pieces of neikotic debris. The work is forever unfinished; even now, tiny spidery robots clamber silky-silent around its edges, all jostling to fit the next piece. The whole thing sways gently in my awestruck gaze. <i>I’ve been here before. </i>In a dreamy and diffuse memory with single vivid freeze-frame peaks, I’ve traveled these sunways and spires.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">I give it a skeptical squint. I think some of these pieces were stolen from my collection.</p>
<p class="p1">“Epsilon City,” comes Dr. Rui’s voice, and he trails it around a corner. Now the name hangs in the air: a threshold, an induction. “But then, I suppose you already know that.”</p>
<p class="p1">A visceral-velcro unpeeling, when I see him in the flesh. Is it fair to resent how difficult he’s made it to hate him? Is it even worth the energy? What his Face left behind is more than unearned sympathy; it is a sketch of Dr. Rui’s own understanding of the world, a framework in which his decision to keep me in the dark makes six kinds of sense. The self-loathing kinda just goes on the pile. He offers me a quiet, knowing look: <i>yeah, yeah — I’m tired of me, too.</i></p>
<p class="p1">The man next to him offers me a stinging handshake, and a question: “Do you know who I am?”</p>
<p class="p1">“I don’t —” I start, and then, <i>pop</i>. “I do! You must be Ma Zhuming!”</p>
<p class="p1">Ma and Rui are both very tall, but otherwise they make quite a contrast. Rui: rail-thin, terminally indoors — though he’s dropped his usual expression of mild surprise for something more lucidly calculating. Ma: ambiguously muscular beneath a sweeping trench coat; long, sleek hair tied back. Smiling with thick lips, thick skin, sunburnt and windbitten. There is a good-cop bad-cop routine working just under the surface here, although I can’t quite decide which man is which. “Good, good. Incredible, if you stop and think about it.” Ma glances at his partner. “Mona, I hope I’m not the first one to say this, but thank you for your service to the Weather Bureau.”</p>
<p class="p1">He seems surprised that this is not what I want to hear.</p>
<p class="p1">“Where’s Tethi? Where have you taken him? What you people do to Chalkers —”</p>
<p class="p1">“Will be no worse than what we did to you,” Ma finishes. Rui gives him a look: <i>why would you say that?</i> But Ma holds my gaze. “Which I, personally, don’t apologize for. What we do saves lives. You were one strange night from wandering into the Chalk, forever, maybe. And that would have been very upsetting for the good doctor Deng.” He angles for a laugh from Rui and, not getting one, goes for a fresh toothpick. I want to hate Ma Zhuming, I really do. But he might be the most honest person in the building.</p>
<p class="p1">Rui tries to clarify. “For the moment, Mr. Okeme is not our concern. But the man is a vector for very dangerous ideas, which will mean either indefinite detention or a <i>very</i> intense linearization protocol. If you cooperate with the Bureau, your input will be taken into account on which it is.”</p>
<p class="p1">“You don’t know him.” At last my disgust at Rui breaks through, but it comes with a half-twist, and makes me very, very sick of the sound of my own voice. “He was just trying to help.”</p>
<p class="p1">“As a matter of fact, I do believe that.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Then why —”</p>
<p class="p1">“The two of you built a network of devices to monitor hundreds of minds. To find correlations. But there are no passive observers of the Mirror Sea. <i>To seek is to find.</i>” Rui edges vortically around an accusation, something he won’t say aloud. “What he meant to do doesn’t matter at all. Under the Weather Bureau’s operating principles, it’s barely even a coherent concept. If we’re picking individual motivations out of the jetstream, the battle is already lost. <i>We are out of time.</i>”</p>
<p class="p1">I keep trying to rearrange those dark circles and worry lines and nerve-set jaw some other way. To finally break the image of the mild-mannered professor, and see the hardness in the face of this man who speaks like we’re at war.</p>
