<p class="p1">Dr. Rui warned me that I’ll forget everything the Face told me, only to remember it over the course of the next several days, triggered by the right cues. But the sunflower patch still is clutched hard in my left fist, and something <i>pops</i>, and suddenly it feels just like I’ve known for years and years that Dr. Deng sent fifteen neikonauts to their deaths. And what if I had known her for a murderer from our first meeting at Stanford? Would things have gone differently then? Not in a way I’m proud to admit. I would have been elated that she felt she could confide in me. Her secret would have been my prized possession.</p>
<p class="p1">I hate this, I <i>hate</i> this, how he’s has denied me the shock of it all. Even when I think about the Weather Bureau weaponizing my inversions — not just against Tenfold Gate, but more than a dozen times since then — there’s nothing that feels new. I try to conjure some spasm of anger and it comes up limp like a fake sneeze. This half-feeling, these sparks that won’t catch, there’s only one thing worth directing them at now. Rui’s Face showed me more than it probably meant to: I can’t remember an address, but the important thing is that I’ll recognize the building from the air. I know where on the roof of Building 6 the Bureau keeps a few spare veetles, and I’m not all that surprised that my fingers remember a six-digit code to open the grate. Am I an instrument of the Bureau? Am I the irreplaceable tip of something very sharp and very expensive? Good. Let’s see them try to stop me.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Cai always said these things fly themselves, but I’m looking at an awful lot of buttons here. I’ve gotten myself into the cockpit of a Bureau medical transport and inched it onto the helipad. I’ve got four of the rotors running and the radio blasting and I think also the heated seats. I’m a foot off the asphalt, then three, then six, and now the button to fire the ion-pulse thrusters goes green. I’m coming for you, Tethi.</p>
<p class="p1">“Transport oh-nine-one, I’m gonna need you to back off the pad for a second there.”</p>
<p class="p1">Another veetle is inbound, fast, something sleek and black and half my size. It makes an orbit of the tower while I figure out how to key the comms to respond. “Uhh, negative.” I hear myself doing a voice. My whole life, my last three years in Shanghai were a cardboard cutout that just fell over and, you know what? I feel cool as a cucumber. I feel pleasantly detached. “Let me just, just gonna...be out of your way in...” Whoa, this thing <i>does </i>fly itself. I have a map dialed up and all I have to do is...</p>
<p class="p1">“Oh-nine-one, this is Captain Ma Zhuming, and I don’t know who authorized you to take out a YINS reserve bird in broad daylight, but it sure as shit wasn’t me. Back off and put down and we’ll see about you keeping your post.” The other veetle hovers about thirty feet away now. Its windows are perfectly reflective. It flashes its brights in consternation. That name sounds ever so vaguely familiar.</p>
<p class="p1">“Captain Ma, this is Mona Xu from the inversions-on-demand department. I’m thinking I might do a quick lap around Pudong and then fly this bitch into the Suowei Tower, how does that work for you?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, hell, I told him not to —” And here follow a string of curses that seem directed at Dr. Rui. “Mona, I’m here to see <i>you</i>. It’s time you spoke to a real person from the Bureau. Let’s please just go inside and have a chat.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Tough stuff, Ma Zhuming.” I angle upward a few feet; everything loose in the cabin <i>thuds.</i></p>
<p class="p1">“Mona, I have Xia Zitian with me. Put down, I repeat, <i>put down.</i>”</p>
<p class="p1">So that was my first ride in a veetle.</p>
<p class="p1">Captain Ma <i>definitely </i>looks familiar, and yet I still can’t place him. As tall as Rui and twice as wide; with dispatches streaming down a pair of affected spectacles, he looks like the bull running the china shop. But he helps the other man out of the backseat with a kind of gentle, brotherly affection, trading handcuffs for a cane.</p>
<p class="p1">“Ma Zhuming. Wait, I <i>do</i> know<i> </i>you!” Dr. Rui’s memory crashes down anew as Ma offers a stinging handshake.</p>
<p class="p1">“Well, nothing to be done about that, I suppose.” The bluelight scowls, leaving little doubt how he feels about Dr. Rui’s Face. “Hope I made a decent first impression in there.”</p>
<p class="p1">The other man lingers behind Ma, with an air of plausible deniability, in coal-black <i>xizhuang</i> suit and tie. Xia Zitian was devastatingly handsome once, before his house arrest left him looking quite so hollowed out. Of course some say his decade of solitude has only added a sort of vampiric aspect to his charm. “Xu Maoli.” He <i>declares</i> my name, in a dusty voice once used to unveil monuments. “The unsung hero of the battle of Tenfold Gate. The student Deng Jinghan decided to take. I hope I can be the first to thank you for your service to the Weather Bureau.”</p>
