<p class="p1">When the Weather Bureau finally released me, a year ago in spring, it was with a toothbrush and a towel and a seventy-two hour ward entry token for Xietu South, where they suggested I might find refuge from the Mirror Sea. The rest of my possessions were to be found in a few waterlogged plastic bags outside the dorm building I had just flooded. <i>The entire city is a great coral reef</i>, only not anymore: A transcendently beautiful Ripple, an entire worldway, had been ripped too suddenly from my eyes — but then, I learned, not only mine. Dozens of other YINS students had opened their taps, too, overcome by the same wave of blind psychotic grief. The building was structurally damaged, closed indefinitely.</p>
<p class="p1">We were instructed not to find each other. To forget and move on. There were faces in the halls that I remembered dearly from those heady weeks, but I had never known them as people, nor they me. We had been each other’s conduits into an achingly beautiful contortion of the world, shared in silence and glance and gesture, that names would only have impeded. We ignored each other conspicuously like jilted ex-lovers staking out corners in a massive negative space. We were survivors of a private apocalypse, with nothing but scar tissue in common. Never in my entire life had I felt so alone, and that was saying something.</p>
<p class="p1">The worst of it, though, was the sense that I was still in Bureau custody, still under observation in one of their warrens. I hallucinated uniformed agents at the edges of my vision, in the back of lecture halls, slipping through unmarked doors. I read too much into obscure research posters on the upper floors. I was fairly certain YINS used the same mango-smelling disinfectant as the Bureau’s holding facility. There was this horrid sense that if I took one step out of line, I’d find myself starting awake in one of their scanner beds, not a day removed from my episode, in one of their linearization sessions. A visored face would peer down, and a re-synthesized voice would tell me: <i>Not bad. Making progress. Let’s try that again.</i> Long after the worst aftershocks had passed, I would pause at the threshold of Building 1 — deep breath — and remind myself that here, of all places, I was out of the Weather Bureau’s reach.</p>
<p class="p1">I was wrong. Or rather, I was right. I was fucking right.</p>
<p class="p1">They’re <i>here!</i> They’re here in this whitewashed warren of frosted glass and mezzanines, behind these locked and unlabeled doors, putting up posters that might even give the whole game away in surface integrals and shanzi, if I could only decode them. They’re here in the negative space behind the Observatory, and probably all over campus too, in the utility closets and the cafeteria and the provost’s office, their influence fractal and all-binding. And of course they are, of <i>course</i> they are: because YINS sits at the rim of a yawning, fathomless parabola of belief that the Ripples are neikonauts in their own right, master artisans of tilespace. That they’re building something they’d very much like us to see.</p>
<p class="p1">Fine, I can believe all that. But <i>Dr. Rui?</i> Really?</p>
<p class="p1">He carries himself differently up here. The glances he gets are deferential. He keeps looking back to make sure I’m keeping up with his lanky stride, and I know he sees the question trying to burst out of me, and his weirdly placid eyes say <i>not now, not yet.</i> Finally, he keys open another door, dark on the inside, and for a wrenching moment I expect to see that pantsuited woman on the floor, ready for a rematch. But it’s just dim track lighting, rows of high black filing cabinets, the mingled scents of burnt coffee and exposed ductwork and fresh voxelite. The door clicks shut and —</p>
<p class="p1">“Where is Tethi going?” I block Rui bodily. “What is going to happen to him?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Please, don’t —” He rocks in place, tries to move around me. “Ms. Xu, we —”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Then something twists in his affect. He sidesteps me and keeps moving. And I see the reluctance with which he drops the act of the mild-mannered professor, or more likely the loveworn death-mask of a previous and more amiable Rui Zhang. Whatever his job <i>is</i> up here, I sense he doesn’t like it much, and he addresses me with a sigh: “For the moment, nothing irreversible. But the man is a vector for very dangerous ideas, which will mean either indefinite detention or a <i>very</i> intense linearization protocol. If you cooperate with the Bureau, your input will be taken into account on which it is.”</p>
<p class="p1">“You don’t know him.” Unrefined disgust runs as sludge through me — but not even at Rui and his sudden break in character, his straightforward cruelty. I am very, very sick of the sound of my own voice. “He was just trying to help.”</p>
<p class="p1">“As a matter of fact I do believe that.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Then why —”</p>
<p class="p1">“The two of you built a network of devices to monitor hundreds of minds. To find correlations. But there are no passive observers of the Mirror Sea. <i>To seek is to find.</i>” Rui’s tone edges quickly, wildly, vortically around an accusation, something he won’t say aloud. “What he himself meant to do doesn’t matter at all. Under the Weather Bureau’s operating principles, it’s barely even a coherent concept. If we spend time picking individual motivations out of the jetstream, the battle is already lost. Please heed me: certain elements of the Bureau want to hotwire you as badly as they do Mbetethi. They think we can get what we need from you without your cooperation. Personally, I think we owe you more.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Need?” It comes out hoarse, half a cough. “Owe?”</p>
<p class="p1">“I would like to explain.” He tries a smile. Something sweet briefly peeks through the sour. “And there is something here that I think you’ll very much like to see.”</p>
