<p class="p1"><i>This is fake, your life is fake, give it a push and it’ll fall right over.</i></p>
<p class="p1">It was the Weather Bureau who taught me how to quiet that voice, and it was the Weather Bureau’s hidden presence at YINS, I’m sure it was, that kept it coming back up. <i>Look, see, it’s flat! Why don’t you have a peek around the edges? </i>But I tamped it down, forced myself to heed reason. There’s simply no way their influence could be so fractal and all-binding. Now I wonder what happens to the occasional undergrad who leaves the circuit of skyways on the lower floors to find out what’s up there in Building 6, in this paranoid maze of frosted glass and mezzanines. Are they hotwired, Faced, and tucked into bed with false memories? Does it happen once a month? Once a week? Every day?</p>
<p class="p1">“What’s going to happen to Tethi?” I try rounding on Ma, but he doesn’t break stride. “I know you people have him, and I know where you’re taking him. And I know...” I almost get ahead of myself here: <i>I know what you people do to Chalkers. </i>“If my work has any value to you, if you want me to keep quiet, I don’t want him harmed, you understand?”</p>
<p class="p1">“What will happen to him is, in principle, what happened to you. Which, by the way, I will not apologize for. The good doctor Deng would not have liked it if we lost you to the Chalk.” He sees my objection and frowns, cutting me off. “Now, some people who have led deeply quadratic lives, they struggle with linearization, they —”</p>
<p class="p1">“They crumple,” I hiss back. And I know how the stories go: imagining Tethi stripped of everything he is, dropped at some random intersection with a white wall of static as a past. This is the kind of situation the Chalk reaches out to meet, but now he’s been stripped of the ability to <i>believe</i> in the right way, he can’t give what it takes, and he slips through the final cracks, dead in a week, found if he’s lucky.</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s not my department,” the policeman says, more quietly now. He looks back at Xia for support, but the man is two steps behind, his expression pleasantly neutral, clearly relishing confinement within a different set of walls. Officially, he’s been checked out for a rheumatics appointment. “Listen, I’m with you, to a point. I think Mr. Okeme is a distraction, but Dr. Rui doubts he was even lucid when you knew him. He considers the man the focal point of the whole thing.”</p>
<p class="p1">“The focal point of <i>what</i>?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Well, to hear him tell it, the end of the fucking world.”</p>
<p class="p1">It’s dark behind the next door, and half of me expects to see that pantsuitted Bureau woman on the floor, waiting for a rematch. The other half knows this place from Rui’s memory. Low track lighting illuminates rows of shiny black file cabinets, and instantly I remember what I’d find if I looked inside: hundreds and hundreds of foam-nestled neikotic eggs. All labeled, in a variety of haphazard coordinate systems, with the place they were found in the Mirror Sea. I even know where to find Tenfold Gate: second row, second on the right, fourth drawer down. How good would it feel to lob the thing at the back of Dr. Rui’s bald fucking head?</p>
<p class="p1">“I’m here,” I jeer when I see him. “I’m ready for that coma! In fact, I’m thinking two months would be nice.”</p>
<p class="p1">Rui is holding court over a group of mathematicians at a great donut of a conference table, or at least he’s trying to. But, God, I can’t even hold the grudge! When he turns around, the image of the mild-mannered professor is shattered. His Face has rearranged his face; those dark circles and worry lines paint a new picture, of a man too long at war. Unearned sympathy floods me for the way he looks pallid and drained, trying to hold court over what looks like half the YINS faculty. Something strange — some <i>self-recognition </i>— lights up his eyes when he sees me.</p>
<p class="p1">“Folks, we’re going to need the room.”</p>
<p class="p1">“So that’s it?” Dr. Guo shouts from the far side of the donut. “We lose? We call it off?”</p>
<p class="p1">“We’re not calling anything off,” Rui snaps. “We couldn’t if we tried.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">They all look tense, filing out, but I don’t go unnoticed by those thousand-yard stares. <i>Deng’s kid,</i> I see one prof mouth to another. Dr. Qin pirouettes and offers me a silent little golf clap. And then it’s just the four of us, gathering along one quadrant of the table. There’s a good-cop bad-cop routine playing just below the surface here, even if I haven’t quite decided who is who. Rui: rail-skinny, terminally indoors — though he’s dropped his usual expression of mild surprise for something more lucidly calculating. Ma: ambiguously muscular beneath a sweeping trench coat; long, sleek hair tied back. Smiling with thick lips, thick skin, sunburnt and windbitten.</p>
<p class="p1">Xia? He just looks happy not to be in charge anymore.</p>
<p class="p1">“You probably don’t want to hear that we’re sorry.” Rui addresses me, after some scraping of chairs. “If I know you, what you want to hear is that you were right. And, Mona, <i>you were right</i>.” He draws my attention upwards; I already know what I’m looking at. Every day the Bureau harvests neikotic debris samples from across the city, and every moment these tiny spidery robots descend from the ceiling on gossamer strands, angling to fit the next piece. The work is half-hollow, forever-unfinished, swaying gently, floodlit from below, but it’s clear what it’s a model of. <i>I’ve been here</i>. In hazy half-memory with vivid freeze-frame peaks, I’ve travelled the sunways and spires of Epsilon City, the place that almost doesn’t exist.</p>
<p class="p1">“It was one of my larger mistakes, not to bring you on sooner. Many times I asked Deng to let us clue you in, but always, she insisted we stay away. I think, at least originally, this was a kindness.”</p>
<p class="p1">I don’t want to look at Rui, and I don’t want him to see me like this. So I’m craning my neck upward, watching the colorful facets of Epsilon City blur with tears. All the new pieces are Sieve debris; the city seems to recede in deference from its egg, as golden skeletal arcs blossom every-which-outways with an ambitious purity of form. A quarter way round comes a great gash, an architectural disaster whose negative space cuts all the way to the core, leaving only traces of Tenfold Gate debris along its fringes. An apocalypse happened there. I know it in my bones.</p>
<p class="p1">After a long moment, after I’ve collected myself, I turn to the trio of men. “Do you really think she’s in there? Not <i>you</i>, I already know exactly how you think. Secretary Xia, Captain Ma, do you actually believe that Dr. Deng left part of herself in the Mirror Sea? Is the...Ripple they became, that what’s behind all this?”</p>
<p class="p1">“I am no Secretary,” Xia offers mildly, “and it was not just her. Sixteen of them diving as one. I hope for their sake that they made it, because I believe it’s what they wanted. And I hope for <i>our</i> sake that they made it —”</p>
<p class="p1">“Because there’s a chance that they remember where they came from. There’s a chance that the Sunflower Sieve is an invitation to parlay, and not just a maker’s mark.” The way Ma says this, I can tell he’s eager to change the subject. “Okay, okay. Dr. Rui, what the hell was that message all about? I don’t like hearing you talk that way.”</p>
<p class="p1">“We’re not ready.” Rui steadies himself. “And we’re going to lose.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Now you listen. I’ve worked my ass off all day to accelerate the timeline. We have <i>hundreds</i> of Ripplechasers ready to deploy tonight, and those may not be the numbers you wanted, but that’s a fighting chance...”</p>
<p class="p1">“And I appreciate that, my friend. And tonight will proceed just as you planned. But we’re going to lose.”</p>
<p class="p1">“How can you possibly know that?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Because Mona and her Chalker friend gave us a kind of data that we consider too dangerous to collect.” With a thin smile, Rui flattens Tethi’s rollscroll, and I want to erupt in protest, <i>that’s not yours</i>. “They built a network of devices to monitor correlations across hundreds of minds, and make no mistake, Mona, <i>to seek is to find</i>.” Rui’s tone edges vortically around an accusation, something he won’t say aloud. “What we have here is the clearest view of Epsilon City ever assembled from neikotic data. It puts what’s dangling above us to shame. Unfortunately it also confirms that the Sunflower Sieve is now expanding directly from mind to mind.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Just like Tenfold Gate,” Ma insists. “And we won that one. It’s compromised, obsolete, not a concern.”</p>
<p class="p1">“We learned the wrong lesson from Tenfold Gate. The debris was painful. It was impossible to ignore. As it expands, the Sieve’s debris is actually becoming more pleasant to hold. Neikonauts aren’t taking the inversion.”</p>
<p class="p1">“So we deliver it through the back door. We put it in front of the cameras.” Ma is getting seriously angry now, or seriously worried. “Again, like we did with Tenfold Gate. Memetics says we’re in good shape. We’ve got street teams already suiting up. We hit those Ripples tonight.”</p>
<p class="p1">“We will. That I can guarantee you. And it will not be enough.”</p>
<p class="p1">“I’m not seeing it, Professor,” Xia offers languidly, bidding Ma calm with a wave of two fingers. “How can you already know this?”</p>
<p class="p1">Ma is not having it. “Rui. Partner, don’t go quadratic on me, not now. <i>We are on the right side of the lens, </i>do you hear me?” He snaps his fingers, trying to break Rui from some reverie. “You can’t know that. Everything that happens in there, it happens out here first. <i>We are in control </i>— I want to hear you say it.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Not anymore.”</p>
<p class="p1">Ma blinks, stupefied.</p>
<p class="p1">“We have it down to the second, actually. You can watch the Sieve structures on the cameras align with the ones in Mona’s data, just at moonrise. And since then, for the first time, we can see structures appearing in the camera feeds before we collect them as debris. And, I said, okay, what do we have here? We have a bipolar, bicausal system, which is what the whole field of neikotics exists to study...”</p>
<p class="p1">“Dumb this down for me, you old prick.”</p>
<p class="p1">“...And o<i>f course</i> you can calculate the net causal flow between them, and so we did, just in time to watch it flip. Jinghan’s known for years, I’m sure. This is what she’s been afraid of, but you know what? We’re still here. <i>We’re still here.</i>”</p>
<p class="p1">“Dr. Rui, what was she afraid of?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Things happen in there first, now. As of quarter past five this morning, the Ripples have reversed causality between Shanghai and Epsilon City.” And I swear the relief on his face tells the whole story. Rui is <i>done.</i> The game the Weather Bureau has been playing for years is finally over, and reality is out of his hands. There’s something gleefully reverent in the way he starts calling up projections of the Mirror Sea. “So who wants to see what happens next?”</p>
