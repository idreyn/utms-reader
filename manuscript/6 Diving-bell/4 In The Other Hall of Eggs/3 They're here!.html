<p class="p1">They’re <i>here!</i> They’re here in this whitewashed warren of frosted glass and mezzanines, behind these locked and unlabeled doors, putting up posters that might even give the whole game away in surface integrals and shanzi, if I could only decode them. They’re here in the negative space behind the Observatory, and probably all over campus too, in the utility closets and the cafeteria and the provost’s office, their influence fractal and all-binding. And of course they are, of <i>course</i> they are: because YINS sits at the rim of a yawning, fathomless parabola of belief that the Ripples are neikonauts in their own right, master artisans of tilespace. That they’re building something they’d very much like us to see.</p>
<p class="p1">Fine, I can believe all that. But <i>Dr. Rui?</i> Really?</p>
<p class="p1">He carries himself differently up here. The glances he gets are deferential. He keeps looking back to make sure I’m keeping up with his lanky stride, and I know he sees the question trying to burst out of me, and his weirdly placid eyes say <i>not now, not yet.</i> Finally, he keys open another door, dark on the inside, and for a wrenching moment I expect to see that pantsuited woman on the floor, ready for a rematch. But it’s just dim track lighting, rows of high black filing cabinets, the mingled scents of burnt coffee and exposed ductwork and fresh voxelite. The door clicks shut and —</p>
<p class="p1">“Where is Tethi going?” I block Rui bodily. “What is going to happen to him?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Please, don’t —” He rocks in place, tries to move around me. “Ms. Xu, we —”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Then something twists in his affect. He sidesteps me and keeps moving. And I see the reluctance with which he drops the act of the mild-mannered professor, or more likely the loveworn death-mask of a previous and more amiable Rui Zhang. Whatever his job <i>is</i> up here, I sense he doesn’t like it much, and he addresses me with a sigh: “For the moment, nothing irreversible. But the man is a vector for very dangerous ideas, which will mean either indefinite detention or a <i>very</i> intense linearization protocol. If you cooperate with the Bureau, your input will be taken into account on which it is.”</p>
<p class="p1">“You don’t know him.” Unrefined disgust runs as sludge through me — but not even at Rui and his sudden break in character, his straightforward cruelty. I am very, very sick of the sound of my own voice. “He was just trying to help.”</p>
<p class="p1">“As a matter of fact I do believe that.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Then why —”</p>
<p class="p1">“The two of you built a network of devices to monitor hundreds of minds. To find correlations. But there are no passive observers of the Mirror Sea. <i>To seek is to find.</i>” Rui’s tone edges quickly, wildly, vortically around an accusation, something he won’t say aloud. “What he himself meant to do doesn’t matter at all. Under the Weather Bureau’s operating principles, it’s barely even a coherent concept. If we spend time picking individual motivations out of the jetstream, the battle is already lost. Please heed me: certain elements of the Bureau want to hotwire you as badly as they do Mbetethi. They think we can get what we need from you without your cooperation. Personally, I think we owe you more.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Need?” It comes out hoarse, half a cough. “Owe?”</p>
<p class="p1">“I would like to explain.” He tries a smile. Something sweet briefly peeks through the sour. “And there is something here that I think you’ll very much like to see.”</p>
