<p class="p1">“I suppose, as usual, it all comes back to Deng. She was very apologetic, when she came in tell me that she’d been poached, but she had such a <i>look</i> on her face that I was, in spite of it all, very excited for her too. I asked her who was doing the poaching, and she said I wouldn’t believe her. I said, try me. She said it was Xia Zitian.”</p>
<p class="p1">Rui walks and talks; he leads me through row after row of shiny black file cabinets. He doesn’t protest when I open them, and find tiny, foam-nestled chunks of voxelite inside. Neikotic eggs.</p>
<p class="p1">“She comes off as a bad liar, is the thing. And she tried to tell me that her appointment was somehow <i>meteorological</i> in nature, and I asked her please not to condescend. We all knew there was only one thing in Xia’s orbit that needed a mind like hers: his great albatross of a surveillance project — but oh how she insisted, even as I was signing the papers to pause her tenure clock, that she was going to work for the Shanghai Weather Bureau. Years later, it fell to me to untangle the bizarre mess of it all that she made, and I realized it was true. That really was where Xia had hidden the cadre of people who maintained the Mirror Sea. Or just that moment, were trying to fix it.”</p>
<p class="p1">Everything on display downstairs in the Hall of Eggs has a title, a date, and a discoverer. But the egg up here have a fourth thing, too: a location, in an inconsistent potpourri of coordinate schemes, where it was found in Epsilon City. The finders are mostly Big Three researchers, but I recognize a few names. I certainly recognize Cai Yuhui’s. And the descriptions, especially the early ones, are mostly whimsical: <i>muffled wingbeats; coniferous symmetry; a way to see the same thing twice</i>. But some of these eggs, I’ve seen in textbooks.</p>
<p class="p1">“What the public knew about the Mirror Sea, they didn’t believe.” Rui’s voice echoes down the hall. I slam this last cabinet shut; I’m falling behind. “But with an ear to the right wall, you’d learn that the system was a theoretical triumph and a practical disaster. The cameras had endless calibration issues. The recommendation system was chasing its tail, and no longer acting in Shanghai’s best interest. When Deng arrived, they had already discovered the Ripples, and among the staffers things had already taken a quadratic turn. But after she examined the Sea from loop-lock, she became convinced that what everyone else was seeing was...how would she have put it? Something like a shadow or a prelude to what was really in there. She spoke of Ripples with a society just as complex as ours, who were master artisans of tilespace, who lived in a place that she began to call Epsilon City.”</p>
<p class="p1">The name hangs in the air: a threshold, an induction. And just behind this last row of cabinets, something else hangs, too. Dangling from countless gossamer strands, just above eye level and gently floodlit from below, the Ripples’ hidden metropolis is halfway reconstructed from thousands — perhaps a million — pieces of neikotic debris. The work is forever unfinished; even now, tiny spidery robots clamber silky-silent around its edges, all jostling to fit the next piece. The whole thing sways almost imperceptibly under my awestruck gaze. <i>I’ve been here before. </i>In a dreamy and diffuse memory with single vivid freeze-frame peaks, I’ve traveled these sunways and spires.</p>
<p class="p1">I squint. I think some of these pieces were stolen from my collection.</p>
<p class="p1">Dr. Rui is the kind of guy who always carries a laser pointer, and he shines a wobbling red dot into the core of Epsilon City, so that it strikes an off-white, opaque smattering of pieces. “The very first of these were hers.” Not even voxelite; they look like they came from an old-fashioned 3D printer. “Early attempts to bring back something of what she saw. If I know her, she would have been frustrated that nobody really believed her. And that’s why she began to train other neikonauts, dozens of them, within the program. She taught them everything she knew, and they were loyal to her for it. And for several years, they dived the Sea. <i>Together.</i>”</p>
<p class="p1">Rui is giving me a very meaningful look, and I’m not picking up what he — <i>oh. </i>“The Bridge!”</p>
<p class="p1">“The Bridge.” He nods grimly. “They explored the Mirror Sea in formations of five, or eight, or even a dozen neikonauts, all wired up in tight topologies, essentially as a single entity. They developed a kind of clairvoyance that Xia came to rely on. I’m told they would remain in Epsilon City for days at a time.”</p>
<p class="p1">A flash-remembered certainty just now: that the Ripples could sense my presence in there, even though I was only watching, far removed in distance and time. And the aftershock of that memory, feeling how much more ripe and real and undeniable the sensation would be, bridged together with <i>eleven</i> other neikonauts.</p>
<p class="p1">“They were trying to make contact?”</p>
<p class="p1">“That wouldn’t have been possible.” Rui frowns, gazes onward. “They were just watching. But though she refuses to talk about it now, I believe they were trying to find a way to bring Epsilon City into something of a broader awareness. They spent so much time together in the Bridge that they may not have had to put it into words. What follows becomes conjecture...but still...I imagine she saw something in Epsilon City that scared her.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Because she quit?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Because she <i>fled</i>. But not before taking the strongest possible measure to kill the Mirror Sea. One Friday morning, she took the project’s entire document archive, cauterized all her work from it, and released it to the public. No one heard from her until several years later when she emerged as an adjunct at a little university in Nagoya.These days, she wants nothing to do with it, which is why she wants <i>you</i> to have nothing to do with it, which is why she did <i>not</i> like seeing that patch in your hand.”</p>
<p class="p1">There’s something there, a half-answered question to probe deeper on, but <i>holy shit —</i></p>
<p class="p1">“Wait, wait, I’m sorry. <i>Deng</i> leaked the Xia Zitian Papers?”</p>
<p class="p1">“She did. And you want to know the worst of it?” Rui twirls the laser pointer idly. “She leaked them to <i>me.</i> She knew I wasn’t fond of Xia, not least because he purloined her from my department at Fudan. To be fair, I was probably her only acquaintance with the slightest Blue Delta affiliation, and she told me this: that I helped them bring Xia down, they’d give me whatever I wanted. But I am no politician. I never knew what I wanted. And that’s how I ended up with her old job, managing relations with Epsilon City, if you can possibly call it that. You could say it’s what I deserved.”</p>
<p class="p1">We make a full, silent rotation around the voxelite city. It appears to pulse between its vantage points. Life and energy and novelty pervade it even in this lifeless and clattering form. Sometimes it draws my eyes through barnacled shantytowns, down squirmways that disappear into other dimensions. Sometimes the random textural jostle of debris produces a neikotic egg; the city seems to recede in deference around it. From such an egg comes a ambitious architectural explosion, whose structures arc outward and only gradually lose their purity of form.</p>
<p class="p1">And there it is: right at eye level, the Sunflower Sieve blooms from the beating heart of Epsilon City, from a <i>facility</i>, and I was <i>there. </i>On the table below us, the spider-bots pick through piles of fresh Sieve debris, fitting them together.<i> </i>No projection in three dimensions could possibly capture the urgency humming along its superstructure, the raw sense of outward expansion in every possible direction.</p>
<p class="p1">“What are they doing there?” I finally murmur. “What do they want?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Attention. Energy. Motion.” Rui glances down at the table and spots something: with a thin and ironic smile, he plucks two pieces of Sieve debris from different piles and hands them to the spiders, which fit them together perfectly. “The human capacity for pattern recognition, and to move in certain subtle ways before the cameras. It would be madness to say we had an <i>agreement</i> with Epsilon City, but what equilibrium existed has been broken. The Ripples there are revealing themselves and their creations more widely, and this signals a new discontent. They know there is a wider Sea for the taking.”</p>
<p class="p1">I keep looking away from Rui, and then back again. Hoping, on first instant, to rearrange those dark circles and worry lines and nerve-set jaw some other way. To see the hardness in the face of this man who speaks like we’re at war. <i>The wider Sea</i>, the euphemism of that — it sets off alarms in my mind that the Weather Bureau itself put there, safeguards against quadratic belief. “No, no, no, no. You’re crazy.” Sudden, horrified clarity in my voice now, maybe the very dregs of it. Maybe this is my last chance to walk away. “Deng is right. This is all insane. You need to turn the cameras off.”</p>
<p class="p1">“We <i>tried</i>.” He betrays such impatience here. “And where did that get us? Those cameras cost five ping on Taobao now. We tried to keep the Big Three from finding Epsilon City, and we might as well have led them right to it. When the Weather Bureau says <i>look away</i>, the city only looks harder. So we distract and misdirect. We try to keep the shallows safe, and the levees from breaking. We hold the line: outside of this room and a very few others, Epsilon City <i>does not exist</i>. Because when it gets our attention, it does not easily let go.”</p>
