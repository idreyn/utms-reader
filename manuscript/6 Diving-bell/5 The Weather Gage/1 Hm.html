<p class="p1">“It’s not quite right to say that we have two windows into the Mirror Sea.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Nothing you say, Dr. Rui, ever comes out quite right.”</p>
<p class="p1">“What we have is two systems...”</p>
<p class="p1">“Two systems.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Two systems exerting mutual influence. Our behavior is picked up by the cameras — after a fashion — and played back to us on those screens. We then interpret what we see on those screens, and that affects our behavior. We are all of us in Shanghai caught in that loop, by second and third and fourth degree, even if we manage not to look at the displays. Even if — for one reason or another — we never go outside.”</p>
<p class="p1">“I go <i>outside.</i> I have a <i>porch</i>. And anyway, I can see the damned thing on the towers at all hours.”</p>
<p class="p1">“It sounds like you’re saying we’re in loop-lock with the Mirror Sea. Only you don’t want to say that.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Captain Ma! We will make a scientist of you yet!”</p>
<p class="p1">“Over my dead body.”</p>
<p class="p1">“But yes, that’s right. Not in the practical sense, of there being magnets and primer tiles. Loop-lock, in the more abstract formulation. Which is why I say with mathematical confidence that we are causally fucked.”</p>
<p class="p1">“But there <i>were</i> primer tiles,” I interject, for the first time in many minutes. “At Wu Ke Nai He. I remember actually being put into loop-lock. Tethi and I, we both met...an entity that presented as Dr. Deng.” The implication finally hits me. “The Bureau was fielding reports from other neikonauts there. We can’t have been the only ones?”</p>
<p class="p1">“You weren’t,” Rui confirms. “A field of sunflowers. It was very widespread.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Did she mention me at all?” Xia butts in cheerfully. “Does she miss me in there?”</p>
<p class="p1">“So I’m saying, <i>literally</i> loop-lock. <i>Literally</i> primer tiles.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Was what <i>you</i> saw. And that’s valuable information, I’m not disputing it. But the Sieve is just as capable of doing this to people with no neikotic channels, and it will use whatever visual stimulus they respond to.”</p>
<p class="p1">“And you’re saying it will do this <i>tomorrow?</i> How can you possibly know?”</p>
<p class="p1">Appropriately enough, we’re going in circles.</p>
<p class="p1">“Look at it this way,” Rui offers. It’s all at the edge of his ability to explain, and I’m pretty sure that doing so violates one of his three rules. He doesn’t care anymore. “Mind to display to mind. <i>We </i>make the Ripples real by noticing them; everything they have ever done, everything they have ever <i>built</i>, it started out in our minds.” He flicks a finger upward towards Epsilon City. “What’s in our heads has <i>always</i> been the leading indicator. What’s on the displays has <i>always</i> followed. It’s something we’ve tracked very carefully.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And then it clicks for Xia. “It has to exist in our minds before we can start seeing it in the displays.”</p>
<p class="p1">And then it clicks for Ma. “Until now. Now the cameras see it first, and <i>then</i> we pick it up as debris.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Right,” gasps Rui. “Right. Now the Mirror Sea cameras are the leading indicator. So we can look at them, we<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>literally dig into the correlations in the feeds, to infer what’s going to happen next. And what happens next is that tomorrow morning, Epsilon City blooms from the shadows. It’s visible on every display. And that corresponds to a cascading change in the nature of human consciousness in Shanghai, which is now already well underway.”</p>
<p class="p1">And then it clicks for me. “No. Deng is right, you’re insane. You need to turn the cameras off.”</p>
<p class="p1">“We <i>tried</i>.” He betrays such impatience here. “And where did that get us? Those cameras cost five ping on Taobao now. We tried to keep the Big Three from finding Epsilon City, and we might as well have led them right to it. When the Weather Bureau says <i>look away</i>, the city only looks harder. So we distract and misdirect, we —”</p>
<p class="p1">“Do you know what I think? You people are the absolute scum of the earth, and if this is so important, it should be easy for you to cause a power outage or something. Now, excuse me —”</p>
<p class="p1">“<i>We try to understand. </i>That was the mandate of the original Weather Bureau. Not to shut it down, not to manage it, but to actually understand it. I actually think that’s possible, you know. That’s what keeps me sane.”</p>
