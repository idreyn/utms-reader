<p class="p1">Everyone can see it now, the lacework in the Sea. And no matter where you stand, it looks like it’s <i>coming. </i>It writhes ever-outwards, lithe and mesmerizing at scale, its wretched joints too small to see. Winding as it does, it’s hard to trace back to its source. But some see something twinkling, some deep-field spackling looking like a city on the seafloor. They point it out to their companions, who can see it too now, and so it cascades. The days are getting short; it’s twilight when Shanghai quits work for the day, and this Thursday is feeling an awful lot like a Friday. Normal people don’t <i>check</i> the Mirror Sea, if they do, they don’t like to talk about it. And it’s not like something new in there is, well, anything new. The psychic tectonics are constant here; eventually you don’t even react when you feel a shift. But this...but <i>this</i>. It’s not a Ripple, or at least not like anyone’s ever seen. It feels too mechanical.</p>
<p class="p1">And it’s on the <i>news</i>.</p>
<p class="p1">“I’m telling them to pull it.” Ma covers the receiver; he’s spear-fishing on speed dial.</p>
<p class="p1">“Don’t,” says Rui. “Or do. It doesn’t matter in the least.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Zitian, tell him he sounds quadratic.”</p>
<p class="p1">“You sounds absolutely quadratic, Professor Rui.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Well then — ?” Ma rolls his eyes. “We’re just going to let him say things like that?”</p>
<p class="p1">Xia Zitian is wearing his coat like a cape, sitting backwards in a chair, and he sounds amused by these developments. He may not run Shanghai anymore, and he may not even run the Weather Bureau, but the two goons who do are constantly competing for his attention, and that’s all the power he ever wants again. “Zhuming, are <i>you</i> going to linearize him?” He waves a loose sleeve in the direction of the news. “What’s your explanation?”</p>
<p class="p1">On the screen, on the <i>news</i>, a wavefront of purple and white throbs in the margins — not the edges of the screen, but at the edge of awareness, with the general effect of inward motion. The higher-order details are bubbly, bulbous, and it only takes a second to resolve as a swarm of diving-bells. <i>Diving-bells.</i> Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="p1">“This is our incursion tonight. You wanted a stream of Ripplechasers, Ma, but you will get a flood. This is magnetic, and it’s going to pull a lot of attention from mainline chases. Cai is going to have her hands full.”</p>
<p class="p1">“But how do they even know about —”</p>
<p class="p1">“Captain Ma, <i>they’re</i> seeing this, too.”</p>
<p class="p1">Who gives <i>me</i> a look, fishing for sympathy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">I grimace past him.<i> </i>“You’re saying we lose?” I ask Rui, hollowly. I’m thinking about how it felt to invert Sunflower Sieve debris, or at least trying to imagine how might feel if I could remember. I’m trying to count the diving-bells, but they look more like a whole than its parts. “You’re saying <i>it</i> wins.”</p>
<p class="p1">“We have more cameras, better angles, better technique.” Dr. Rui nods, switching to an internal feed. “We can find more correlations, draw more conclusions. We can see the...” And I can see the word <i>future</i> trying to burst out of him, like he wants to say it so, so bad. He fights it down. “The consequences. Watch.”</p>
<p class="p1">The Sunflower Sieve debris appears to both spring forth from Epsilon City and dredge it from the hypnagogic depths. But who could still call it <i>debris</i> when it unfolds like that, interlaces like that, flexes like that? And it is so weirdly, deathly silent when the diving-bells make contact, engaging it battle, in complicated little eddies of coincidence, and here is me drinking in the image, trying to remember the logic of it, so invested in catching them in their game that I don’t even notice when they start to lose. The Sieve is dense, and solid where it needs to be, and almost liquid where it needs to be. And it’s eating me alive...</p>
<p class="p1">...and it’s <i>resolving</i> into Epsilon City now, as though Ripples are moving in, outwards from the center districts but more and more from the outskirts, from the wild Sea, the outer Sea, and the euphemism of <i>that</i>. And I’m seeing it at close range, a kind of street-level range, as these wild Ripples have their first interactions that play by any rules than those of Nature, and they’re learning the game that is the City, and I’m learning the game too, I’m learning to see how their contraptions work how their laws work how their families work how their lives work how their</p>
<p class="p1">“Deng’s right.” I hear myself say. “You need to turn the cameras off.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Mona — this is what she does not understand. This does not disappear when we look away.”</p>
<p class="p1">“If this is what you say it is, we need to —”</p>
<p class="p1">“If this is what I say it is —”</p>
<p class="p1">“— do <i>something</i> about it.”</p>
<p class="p1">“— then there is <i>nothing</i> we can do about it.”</p>
<p class="p1">“I think you’re crazy. I think you’re <i>all</i> crazy. And you know what else? I think the Weather Bureau is the low-down scum of the earth, and <i>you’re</i> what’s wrong with this city, and if you wanted to, if you really, <i>really</i> wanted to, you could shut the entire Mirror Sea down like that. Like<i> that</i>. Because I happen to know <i>exactly </i>what kind of evil shit you are capable of — you, Dr. Rui. Aaaand you. And especially you —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I mean! Cause a fucking power outage —”</p>
<p class="p1">“I am so, so, <i>so</i> sorry for what we did to you,” says Dr. Rui, and does he mean it? Could I even tell whether he means it through layer after layer of tricks and schemes? “Mona, you will get what you deserve —”</p>
<p class="p1">“I will <i>never</i> get that.”</p>
<p class="p1">“You will get a place —”</p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, I will get a <i>place?</i> Finally, I will have a <i>place!</i> Oh, Mona gets a <i>place </i>— shut the fuck up! Do you <i>really</i> think I want to come work for you? You <i>violated</i> me, you weird! Old! Men! You made me feel wrong in ways that nobody else has even <i>discovered </i>yet. And now what, I get a <i>badge</i>, I get <i>free coffee</i>, I get <i>to kill people who scare me, ‘cause they’re different</i>? Well, guess what, Rui Zhang, it does <i>not </i>just feel good to be included!”</p>
<p class="p1"><i>“You will not survive this without us!” </i>Ma Zhuming leans in to defend his partner. “They say you’re pretty smart, missy, but even I can see that you are pretty fucked if you try to weather this without us. That’s you in there, plain and simple. It’s happening <i>to you.</i>” And now he faces Rui indignantly. “Which does <i>not</i> mean I believe what you’re saying.”</p>
<p class="p1">“So we attack, and it fights back, and we lose?” Xia is so airily calm I almost have to laugh. And apparently he hasn’t made up his mind yet. “The Ripples get smart, and now everyone gets to watch Epsilon City on the displays. And, I really do mean this with the utmost reverence and respect, so what?”</p>
<p class="p1">“You know what, Xia. You of all people know what.” Rui scowls. “Within the next day, Shanghai will experience a radical, cascading change in human consciousness. Things will just <i>be different</i> here. The Sunflower Sieve will — how do I put this — mediate our interactions in a new way. I can’t say exactly what it will feel like, but I’ll bet it’ll be much more like <i>them</i> than like <i>us</i>.”</p>
<p class="p1">“And?”</p>
<p class="p1">“<i>And?</i>”</p>
<p class="p1">“It just looks like you had an <i>and</i> there,” Xia offers timidly.</p>
<p class="p1">Rui sighs. “And it’ll feel so damn good that no one will ever want to go back.”</p>
