<p class="p1">“What’s going to happen to him?”</p>
<p class="p1">The back office of the Observatory is a maze of narrow halls ending constantly and unpredictably walls of frosted glass. Dr. Rui doesn’t answer, but he looks back constantly to make sure I’m keeping up with his lanky stride. I have a whole cascade of questions, actually, all stemming from visceral half-memory, all with the slippery sheen of antipattern sedative: of white walls, the smell of paint drying, and especially of the deep-field speckles of the linoleum; these had entertained me with hours of galactic wobbling between my debriefs and linearization sessions. <i>Was it here? Is this where the Bureau took me?</i> Rui keys open a dark room, and with all my knotted-up depths I expect to see that visored woman sitting on the floor, ready for a rematch. But inside there’s only dim track lighting and long rows of heavy metal cabinets.</p>
<p class="p1">The Weather Bureau’s treatment of the blameless is unpleasant. Their work when they get their hooks into a Chalker is gruesomely legendary. Above all I need Rui to swear to me that they’re going to keep Tethi in one piece. I led him here, I led him right into this…and now what? I move to block Rui bodily, the same question on my lips.</p>
<p class="p1"><i>“What is going to happen to him?”</i></p>
<p class="p1">“Come now, Mona, what do you think?” He loses his temper with a flustered <i>pop</i> and regains it by the end of the sentence. “You have no idea how much trouble is bearing down on you right now. The Bureau wants to hotwire you as badly as they do Mbetethi. It’s my discretion that’s keeping them out of your head.”</p>
<p class="p1">“You don’t know him.” I sound small, desperate, and just as helpless as I really am. I am suddenly very, very sick of the sound of my own voice. “None of you do. He was just trying to help.”</p>
<p class="p1">“As a matter of fact I do believe that.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Then why —”</p>
<p class="p1">“The two of you built a network of devices to monitor hundreds of minds. To find correlations. But there are no passive observers of the Mirror Sea, Mona. <i>To seek is to find.</i>” Rui’s tone edges quickly, wildly, vortically around an accusation. Around something he won’t say aloud. “What he himself meant to do doesn’t matter at all. Under the Bureau’s operating principles, it’s barely even a coherent concept. If we spends time picking individual motivations out of the jetstream, the battle is already lost.”</p>
<p class="p1">And I keep looking away and then back at Dr. Rui. Hoping each time, on first instant, to finally pierce the image of the mild-mannered professor. To rearrange those dark circles and worry lines and nerve-set jaw some other way. To see the hardness in the face of this man who speaks like we’re at war. “You’re crazy,” I say, just to spite him.</p>
<p class="p1">“We’ve kept a great deal from you, Mona.” And just to spite me, he speaks clearly and kindly. “But I would hope that you’re not just discovering that now?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">* * *</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Inside the cabinets are hundreds and hundreds of neikotic eggs. Their little printed labels recall those in the Hall of Eggs, with discoverers, dates, and descriptions. Only these have a fourth row: locations, in a variety of haphazard coordinate systems, in the Mirror Sea. Most are rough-hewn asymmetrical things, with whimsically obscure descriptions. <i>Muffled wingbeats. A way to see the same thing twice.</i> I take one labeled <i>gummy bear dance?? </i>and trace its spirals with my thumb. “Who is finding these?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Most of the junk is from YINS students. As I believe you know, the Observatory sometimes offers our scanner beds to Institute affiliates. We give them a tiny trickle of feeds, keep them in the shallows, and let them propagate the idea that there’s nothing of particular interest for neikonauts in the Sea. It’s important that the public believe we have nothing to hide.”<i> </i>But down the line of cabinets, left to right, top to bottom, the eggs begin to offer concrete utility: <i>Point-free annealing</i> or <i>convex-hull generation. </i>Rui runs his long fingers spider-wise over these. “Of course, the Big Three have observatories of their own, each with an inner circle of neikonauts who must, I imagine, return to soberspace remembering <i>something</i> of what lurks in the deepest correlations of the Sea. Though how literally they interpret these trips, I can’t say. The Bureau has arranged to be notified if they find something of interest, which —”</p>
<p class="p1">“<i>No.</i>”</p>
<p class="p1">“I’m sorry?”</p>
<p class="p1">“I can’t believe you. You <i>used </i>me.” My own voice sounds distant. In the final cabinet, top drawer, I find an egg that’s sharply geometric, red-orange, concentrically reflective — one that needs no introduction. I never hatched it, but there’s a feeling, recalled only in my fingertips, the satisfaction of pulling its barbed shards from Cai’s mind. Something pinwheels in my stomach. <i>Cai works here, at the Observatory. Which means —</i></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah. This is where you come in.” Rui says brightly. “The Tenfold Gate crisis.”</p>
<p class="p1">“You sent her down to the clinic!”</p>
<p class="p1">“Of course we did.” His tone is one part contrition, three parts delight that I pieced it together so quickly. “Which is standard operating procedure. If you think of the Neikotic Safety clinic as an arm of the Bureau, it —”</p>
<p class="p1"><i>“You sent her to live with me!”</i></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah. Well, that one was out of my hands. The Bureau wanted eyes on Dr. Deng, which meant eyes on you.”</p>
<p class="p1">Just how many times had Cai appeared at the Neikotic Safety clinic at closing time, always with awful debris from Tenfold Gate? Did I ever bother to ask what she was doing with it? It hits me in a flash of lurid deduction: Deng refused to use the Bridge, so the Bureau flicked its tendrils through YINS to find someone who was willing. It didn’t have to go far. And they sent their employee — their <i>agent </i>— down to the clinic again and again, to study the inversion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But why Cai? In retrospect, I have no trouble imagining her as a Bureau asset. But she’s a Ripplechaser. Her expertise is on manipulating public attention, on redirecting eyes <i>en masse...</i></p>
<p class="p1">Oh. <i>Oh.</i></p>
<p class="p1">Cai received my Tenfold Gate inversion, studied its grammar and inflections, and wove them into the subtleties and fine structure of a delusion with such seductive gravity that it warped the social fabric of Shanghai. She sent a Ripple careening back into the Mirror Sea bearing a counter-weapon in its subtleties and fine structure. <i>The entire city is a great coral reef.</i> If that ever seemed a little too straightforward, a little too on the nose, that was only because it was the spoonful of sugar the Weather Bureau’s memeticists concocted to help the medicine go down.</p>
<p class="p1">If this sounds psychotic, fine. But know that for me, the realization comes with a wave of stupendous relief. Something subliminal clicks together with downright cryptographic certainty. On my own, I’d never guess it in a million years. But with the pieces in hand, their edges aligned in just the right way, it’s trivial to verify. <i>The entire city is a great coral reef.</i> No wonder I took to it so readily, mourned it so...thoroughly. The entire time, it had a piece of <i>me</i> woven into it.</p>
<p class="p1">And so, for one pleasant moment, I can’t even be furious with Dr. Rui and the Weather Bureau’s machinations. Against all my proclivities I can only feel pride in myself, and Cai, and what we managed to accomplish together.</p>
<p class="p1">“Why didn’t you just <i>tell</i> me?”</p>
<p class="p1">[Oh right. I can be mad at Deng. <i>Is this just the WB psyoping me?]</i></p>
<p class="p1">[We’re telling you now. You two are going to make a hell of a team.]</p>
