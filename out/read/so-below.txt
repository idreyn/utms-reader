Of course I have a light on me — but everyone else has Contecs, and I don’t want to draw attention to myself. I sure don’t want to blind them. Behind me, the Weather Bureau seems to be having a hell of a time unsealing a door — the fucking <i>Weather Bureau, </i>Mona! W<i>hat are you doing here?</i> So I creep forward, letting the <i>guangpan</i> draw subtle constellations of purple across my darkness, trying to keep voices within earshot. But they’re already dampening and fanning out. The tunnels are already branching, and I’ve made how many unknowing choices? Three? Four? I hold one hand out against the darkness, and the other traces the wall. The slimy, chalky texture accumulating on my fingers confirms what I already know.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The silence becomes the darkness, and finally, inevitably, I am alone.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">But, God, isn’t this what I had always wanted?</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">It’s called Ripplechasing, not Chalker-chasing. But back in that brief and brilliant period of my life, we all understood tacitly that finding one involved seeking the other. The Chalkers were where the Ripples were. They moved with them at night, or they moved them at night — the language of causality fails here, and that’s just how they like it. Cai Yuhui chased for a firebug, scattershot kind of fame, a knack for finding and being found, for showing up one minute before the Ripple with legions watching through her eyes. I wanted the opposite. I wanted to feel the adoring gaze of the city and not refract it one bit. I wanted to be made of glass. We orbited it, on a high ecliptic, all for our own reasons, for community, for bounties, for cardio. But the Chalkers operated inside of it, and we watched their operations from a safe distance, warped and distorted and lensed, always feeling nervously for an event horizon.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Of course we knew about the tunnels.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">We knew that they were everywhere, and that they were no one’s idea. We knew that, in Xia’s day, they had the first whispered sign in the halls of power that the something was askance in the daily, rolling five-year plans produced by the Mirror Sea.<i> We’re building how many new subway lines?</i> someone finally thought to ask. <i>How many sewer mains?</i> But by the time they found the Ripples lurking in the system’s hidden layers, legions of tunnel-boring machines were in the ground. By the time Xia Zitian took to that podium to confess, some of those tunnels had tracks, and some of them periodically flooded. And now they’re all covered in chalk.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">I know I’m not supposed to look, but — <i>this is insane, Mona, that you’re even considering this —</i> I need to see it for myself, I need to know, I whip out my phone and engage the flash — <i>and keep it on, for God’s sake! And run!</i> Sure enough the harsh white light reveals dull white chalk, hallucinatory scribbles in knots and hooks and whorls, for what feels like infinity in both directions. And lining the ceiling at luxuriously close intervals are bulbous teardrop cameras, clustered in fours, infrared sensors trained on the chalk dripping imperceptibly slowly down the wet walls. <i>You’re blinding them!</i> I’m starting to get my wires crossed. Am I supposed to keep my flash on or not? <i>Mona, do you or do you not still believe that the Chalker tunnels are a sacred space, a quiet place where the Ripples go at night to dream?</i></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Blame it on the <i>guangpan</i>, if you want. Blame it on that vantablack spikiness, smoothed down now but still nestled between logic and reason. Blame it on the fact that I never charge my phone, and I’m sitting pretty at eleven percent. But I kill the flash, and I still see the chalk.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">An afterimage, sure, but an afterimage that moves as my head does, that doesn’t care if my eyes are open or closed. At first it’s the color of nothing, of infrared leaking into the visible spectrum, the same nothingness that I perceive in faint dotted rings around each camera lens. But is the chalk really <i>that</i> reflective? Or...or...or something else? Here I float, at the Lagrange point between reason and madness. Here I strike the bedrock of Shanghai’s garden of delusion, that indifference to the difference between correlation and causation, between light and sight. And as I take my first steps forward — <i>what else I am I supposed to do?</i> — the chalk begins to wiggle, to accumulate, to integrate into a dull red glow. It’s, it’s...<i>it’s not too late to turn your flash back on. There’s got to be a manhole, a ladder, a quick way out...</i></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">But all uncertaintly is subsumed now by this: <i>you’ve been so, so good.</i> <i>You’re been so good, for so long.</i> I walk faster, the walls clearly in sight, now positively crawling with texture, with gnosis, with meaning thrumming in harp-struck chords behind my eyes<i>. It’s been more than a year now and you’ve barely peeked. You upended your routines, you moved apartments, you holed yourself inside.</i> The red is starting to peel apart into other colors, unflattening into browns and greens. <i>You even made a friend here, and you gave that up too.</i> The color is peeling off the wall, into the tunnel itself, becoming the tunnel itself. <i>And for what, Mona?</i> I can still feel my legs breaking into a long stride and then a run, but only barely. I am the blurry fact of motion, a disturbance along an axis, an implementation detail. <i>You’re going out. And if you hurry, you can join in.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">I burst out of the tunnel at breakneck speed, in a dozen different places, at a dozen different moments. It’s not that I don’t know where I am — quite the opposite. A footbridge across the trickling Zhangjiang, a wide and windy Century Avenue, a shed near a burbling fountain outside a great metro station. I recognize all these places, but they’re<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>mere floaters in my eyes as I unfurl myself into the city to see and be seen, to decorate a hundred walls. <span class=\"s1\">A second sun erupts diode by diode to soak Shanghai’s streets in soap-bubble suchness for anyone who cares to simply stop and see. The rain has passed, and the dead of night is not dead at all.</span><span class=\"s2\"> </span><span class=\"s3\">[There should be some description here of finally seeing a Ripple from many different angles, and getting a true sense of their shape.]</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">I am a mossy maelstrom of butterflies and antlers and roots and cilia, in which nothing persists for longer than a moment before decaying elegantly into something new. Snail palm shells fronds. Periwinkle is not a color it's my whole circulatory system inhaling blooming exhaling decaying into the barnacular the tentacular, a recurring negative space in creation. Briefly, of all things, I am even <i>people</i>. In in my selfishness, in my insistence of primacy, I see a hand in front of a face, but I simply let go of that miserly fool, who ever dared think a single atom or joule could ever belong to her. Velveteen cycles of creation and destruction, wing and bone, lit gently and obliquely from nowhere at all. A hawk, a mouse, and a mushroom are eating each other, and this strange loop is my shoulder? No, someone is shaking my shoulder...</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“Hey, it’s <i>you</i>!”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">I remember this woman...with the dress made of <span class=\"s1\">traffic-cone shells</span><span class=\"s2\"> </span><span class=\"s3\">[Mona should, earlier, see this in the Sea. Good touchpoint for the confusion/delusion/blurring inherent to chasing]</span>...from the elevator at Double Descent. These facts were never absent, not really, but a detail snaps into focus, and that detail is Mona Xu. <i>It never lasts, the way it lasts...</i>that’s my sad absurd little thought, but she’s beaming at me with a joy that says I know you, that says let’s go ’til morning, and maybe it’s not so bad, suddenly, to be a detail in such eyes, dark velvet wrapped in orange-red reassurance. Maybe there are hours to go.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“We think we know where it’s headed.” Her hand wraps, soft and a little clammy, around my wrist. “Let’s go.”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">I manage to tear my eyes away from the gigantic quasigram along god-knows-what boulevard, feeling the awful kink in my neck, seeing outer tendrils of the Ripple flickering in the scan lines. It looks like — well, a little of everything. It’s a carnival of pareidolia: wings and bones and roots, always already dead. I see it reflected in her dress, in the the fixpoint snailshell shapes designed to tag the Ripple, to make it through the slice-and-dice of the Mirror Sea’s anonymization algorithm unscathed. I see it in the garments of the others Ripplechasers scattering down the street, and — what on earth is this? — in the wreath of dried flowers that someone’s plunked onto my head. Back in my day, we had been going for more of a coral reef look. But maybe that had been too on the nose.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The last wisp of the Ripple disappears. It’s fair to say that the next thing I know, I’m somewhere else entirely.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hours later, when it’s finally plain old me, my big question is how I got across the river. I started in Pudong and now, with the sun rising across my back, I am walking through deep Puxi, just one ward from home. I suffer not a dearth of memory, but an excess, a hypermemory. In its facets I take the Metro and walk a footbridge and even hang hooting and hollering from the side of a veetle. Are any of these mine? Are they even real? The comedown felt like a pleasant, lazy slide that narrowed, and narrowed me, until I <i>plunked</i> irreversibly back into my own subjectivity. Trying to peer back up it now, it seems impossibly steep. Part of it is pride, too. If we had managed to move a Ripple across the Huangpu, I can’t help but think, that was damn fine work.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">My last Ripplechasing stint ended in disaster, in a graduate dormitory suite waist deep with water from every tap I could open. I also had to take a class. <i>Remedial belief modulation</i>, in a building across town; its drabness only fed my suspicion that it was Weather Bureau headquarters. The instructor drew a squeaky parabola on the board and wrote the words: QUADRATIC BELIEF. You give it <i>this</i> much, he explained, and it gives you <i>that</i> back squared, and so you feed it and feed it. Yes, <i>you</i> in the back, you personally. We had all shown ourselve susceptible to quadratic belief, and we were all to avoid so much as thinking about the Mirror Sea — nevermind that we could see it through the window blinds — as it was a canvas on which we might paint any delusion, any fantasy, any distortion of consensus reality.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But once in a while, maybe that’s what I need.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">After days of rain the sweetness of the sun tinges our world, drying the damp from my YINS hoodie, calming the shiver in my bones. It touches their world, too. Projected stories high on the wall of a parking ramp, the Sea erupts with fragmentary, concentric bursts of orange in all the places you don’t expect. You could intuit a lot about the operation of the Lam-Waldmann Hash by watching these blooms. Or at least someone could. <i>I’m</i> freezing and hungry and focused on remembering how to use my feet. The Ripples are properly out now, ordinary Ripples of traffic and street cleaning and middle managers on morning jogs. Against my better judgement I stop and stare, one more time, grasping for that slippery impression of how it felt to see one through fifty pairs of eyes at once. Of how they’re <i>really </i>shaped.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A tiny pipsqueak of a thing nips at the edge of a much larger Ripple. This is to be expected. When two Ripples collide, sloshed or jostled or maybe egged on, they interfere, flaying each others’ outer layers into decoherence. Whether this is fucking or fighting or finnicking, that’s above my pay grade. But we can all at least agree that it obeys the principles of wave mechanics, and that it makes for a hell of a show. The little one might be a wake-parasite, hitching a ride on the big one’s motile force. It might be a small part of a larger self, trying desperately to recohere before it being forgotten in the churn. It might —</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I stop dead in my tracks, look and look again. There’s no way.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“<i>Crazies</i>!” A delivery driver squeals to a stop in front of me, hollering out the window. “Lowlife nutcases!”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I’m across two lanes of traffic, four, dashing across the street to get a better look at that tiny blob before it flits away. Now I’m right up against the screen, the heat of individual pixels, craning my neck. The way the blob undulates, the zebra-stripe patterns that thrum concentrically along it, are more than familiar — <i>much</i> more than familiar. <i>This </i>is quadratic belief, this is the shallow of the parabola and <i>you need to look away right now</i> because it’s only gonna get deeper. But I barely even blink. I drink in the sight until I’m either absolutely sure, or sure I’ve lost it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There in that paraeidolic maw, in that churn of everything and nothing, swims the diving-bell.</p>\n</section>"}}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"ChapterQuickNav_chapterQuickNav__EXp_8","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"ChapterQuickNav_previous__EhnLJ","children":["$","a",null,{"href":"/read/double-descent","children":"← Previous"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"ChapterQuickNav_contents__HfJVg","children":["$","a",null,{"href":"/read","children":"Contents"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"ChapterQuickNav_next__HJcYI","children":["$","a",null,{"href":"/read/come-down","children":"Next →"}]}]]}]]}],null],"segment":"__PAGE__?{\"slug\":\"so-below\"}"},"styles":[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/54145c9c9d4bbf45.css","precedence":"next"}]]}],"segment":["slug","so-below","d"]},"styles":[]}],"segment":"read"},"styles":[]}]}]}],null]
