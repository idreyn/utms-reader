            "content_html": "<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">Everyone in Shanghai knows what a neikonaut looks like.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And if you don't — board a train bound for Pudong, and find it peppered with young people in designer silks and Italian leather and gold rings, paired with a puffy vest from a large financial firm. You'll see some false positives: middle managers, or regular traders in a less intimate relationship with their Bloomberg terminals. The giveaway is the hair, with cutouts where they need to be for the sensors to make contact. Or the fact that he's — let's face it — he's sitting half-lotus across three subway seats, dutifully clearing his mind. You glance at him, he glares at you, and you go back to playing <i>mihuan mengyuan </i>on your wanji.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Or maybe it's just dusk, and you see him stumbling out of the Suowei or Paracoin offices with three or four of his work buddies. His vision is still wobbling from a day in loop-lock, or maybe he's already hitting his tryptamine pen, dipping back in to smooth over painful fragments of arcane and proprietary trading algorithms. Maybe it's nighttime in Xintiandi, and there are whole packs of them wandering the streets, cheering and jeering in lines outside basement clubs and crash-landing their veetles in the flowerbeds. They've switched to tacts and phens by now — no cross-tolerance with the work stuff — and they've mostly shed their vests for gauzy black shirts, chunky heeled boots, and nightshades. You look at him, his eyes graze you, but then you realize he's staring at the dripping neon quasigram behind you, seeing it move in ways you can't.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Or maybe it's far past midnight in one of those Xintiandi basements, and the smoke is doing funny things to the lights, and the lights are doing funny things to the music, and you think the bassline might come up on your EKG, and his too when you see him. In ultraviolet light you see those tattoos clearly: blacklit loops and whorls across his torso and arms. Inscrutable obscenities and vows. And then for a moment, his dilated eyes. Briefly you imagine what might be left over behind them, what it could possibly be like to go through life that way. Whether he's trying to remember, or trying to forget.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>That's</i> a neikonaut, and maybe it's no secret why the word picks up a kind of sneering, rhotic derision as it leaves the mouth of your typical <i>Shanghairen</i>. Everyone knows that it all comes back to them — the estrangement with Beijing, the fragmentation of a single city into hundreds of wards, the parallel yuan. Then there's the weirder stuff, the smoke between your fingers at the bottom of the bottle, the way it all just feels haunted. Even the biggest detractors have conceded neikotics isn't <i>causing</i> mass psychosis, not directly. Even the CCP calls it <i>quadratic belief.</i> But when you step outside and discarded vials of huixing and qingting<i> </i>crunch beneath your feet, street names barely emerged from a primordial alphabet soup — well, who else is there to blame?</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yao Tongduan meets me at the door to the clinic, finds me panting and sweating through a set of totally superfluous scrubs. He clicks his pen impatiently. “You picked one hell of a day to come late.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">No I didn’t. I’m late practically every morning. A year ago Yao was a fresh-faced freshman, putting in long hours at the front desk for a preferential slot in the Applied Neikotics lottery. When he made the program, he started looking the clinicians in the eye, and when he achieved loop-lock, he started swearing at us like a proper shift manager. I sort of prefer this.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It’s all on the checklist, Yao. Coffee maker needs a double tap. Toilet paper in the back closet.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I’m serious, Mona.” He pronounces my English name in a rising, then falling, but mostly exasperated tone. “We have a patient.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“And you, my friend, have your cert now.” I jab towards the N-1 license <i>(provisional)</i> dangling proudly from his lapel. “Says you’re qualified to do inversions now and everything. You think you’re up for it?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“No, this is — c’mere.” Yao sounds nervous, and suddenly I feel foolish. “Follow me.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The YINS Neikotic Safety clinic gets two, maybe three patients a day. Mostly the neikonauts Shanghai doesn’t see — the mathematicians and engineers, less ostentatious than the financiers but hardly less reckless in loop-lock. When Yao leads me into the scanner room, I expect a half-familiar face from the halls. Some fellow student who got lost in the catacombs of category theory, and now winces at right angles, that sort of thing. But I don’t quite know what to make of the man already lying in the scanner bed.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He looks West African, about my age, curly locks falling to his shoulders and a zircon rhombus embedded in his forehead. The wanji around each of his wrists is idly hallucinating runes, and his mesh tank top is an admirable idea in this heat. I approach the scanner bed and his eyes track me, barely. This man has a face predisposed to smiling, but right now he’s in obvious pain.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Hi, I’m Mona Xu,” I tell him, extending a hand he seems unlikely to shake.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He turns his head as far as the loop-lock headset will let him and groans, <i>“Yi....yi-sheng?”</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Not a doctor,” I tell him, trying not to think about what 400 blank pages look like stacked on my advisor’s desk. “But close as you’ll get this morning. You got a name?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He makes a sound — it’s hard to be more specific — and then closes his eyes, wincing at something unseen. Yao and I have a silent exchange:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Holy shit!</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Yeah</i>,<i> I warned you</i>, his eyes say.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>We duck behind the control bank, maybe kinda out of earshot.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“This is <i>bad</i>.” Like 98<span class=\"s1\"><sup>th</sup></span>-percentile bad. “Have you gotten anything else out of him?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Not at all,” Yao’s round face is shaded with concern. “He stumbled in about half an hour ago — didn’t even fill out a waiver, mind you — and collapsed into the scanner bed.” He passes me an N-1 license on the usual turquoise lanyard, with a name, <i>Mbetethi Okeme</i>, and its owner’s face in a cheesy grin that suggests he’s getting away with something. “If he has any other ID, it’s on his person.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“So what’s he do for a living? Vest type?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“No vest,” Yao shrugs. “But he’s got the look of someone in that orbit. My guess is lone-wolf trader feeding on whalefall. Because, check this out.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Mbetethi’s rucksack is stuffed with bits and pieces of electronic salvage: LCD screens and beamformers and batteries and GPUs. If you <i>really, really</i> knew what you were doing, you could build a working loop-lock headset or two from what’s inside. If you get one little thing wrong, well...</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“He’s lucky to be alive,” I mutter. “I don’t even wanna know, but what’s in his ‘folds?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">All six of the control bank screens are almost humming with color, fractalized swirls of organic thought like the inside of a higher-dimensional marble. Each is a different vantage point on the thing that’s causing Mbetethi so much pain: a nearly white-hot bolus of jagged, pixelated noise lodged in the 32-dimensional manifolds of the Standard Neikotic Projection. If you ask where some process is happening in the cells of the brain, the answer is <i>everywhere, kinda</i>. The ‘folds give you something you can point to. Dr. Deng loves to chastise us about how these images are projections of projections, how they don’t purport to show cause and effect, but it sure <i>seems</i> like the debris lodged in his mind is tangling up the gently undulating sheets of his very soul like a kite stuck in a washing machine.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Can we oversample on the lower tau band?”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yao mashes a few keys and the picture slides from greens to violets.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">At a surface level the picture is pretty, even mesmerizing. A few fathoms deep and I understand it, loosely, as mathematical constructs escaped from seminars I passed by a hair. But deeper and deeper still...there’s a part of me, dormant now, that <i>knows</i> this colorful space, is roused gently by even these shadows of shadows. To see it scarred in this way brings up bile, but mostly a shot of adrenaline so strong it pools in my fingertips. <i>I can fix this, I know I can,</i> even if from down here I can scarcely imagine how.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Down a few megahertz?” I ask, trying to smooth all of this out of my voice.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I’ll save you the trouble.” Yao replies in a lowered voice, but he taps at an arrow key and winces as something like a pufferfish briefly takes shape. Mbetethi lets out a despairing groan from a few meters away.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>“I cross-checked it against the whole Municipal database, and the scraps we have from Suowei, and not a single inversion in the database will bind to it. Most of them can’t even <i>detect </i>it. This is totally novel. Brand new. <i>Wo cao</i>, Mona, can you try not to look so excited?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“What?” But I can’t help but let a smile rise from that deepness inside me. “Is it showing?”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">See, at the end of a loop-lock session, when the primer tiles stop and the drugs wear off, whatever computational constructs you were working with will disintegrate. They leave behind the sensation of cathedrals collapsing silently in six dimensions, of powerful truths rendered obscurely into decaying frescoes, of illuminated texts being shut in the tomb of the last person who could read them. Depending on who you ask this is like waking pleasantly from a profound if deeply strange dream, or like having a stroke. It’s not for everyone. There’s a thousand-yard stare you see these days, from traders on the subway or Fields medalists on the podium, their breakthrough in hand, but the intermediate steps belonging to the human-machine hybrid that, for a short time, they <i>were</i>. That bothers people — it bothered Adrianna Lam enough to spend years returning to her Collatz proof at smaller and smaller doses, trying to understand <i>how she got there</i>, leading to a wave of secondary results. It bothered Peter Waldmann enough to take a sledgehammer to the machine in Goettingen where he did his wormhole structure work, leading him to a showdown with Interpol.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Sometimes these existential crises find their way to our little basement clinic, but to put it bluntly, they’re not our problem. We refer them to counseling on a floor with windows. Like I said, when you exit loop-lock, your mind springs back to its original, organic shape. Mostly, usually. But things can get...left behind. Lodged up in there. Sometimes it’s a fantastically complex graph structure, casting spindly shadows, forcing complicated detours — you can’t think straight, because you have to go around it. Sometimes it’s a million pieces of digital gravel, each byte just — <i>crunch! crunch! </i>— against every other. Or sometimes it’s a megalithic crystalline shard, splitting the background noise of life into prismatic arcana. It stays behind, rattles around, takes on a life of its own. It’s computational residue, is what it is. Junk, waste, debris.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">And Clinical Neikotics is in the business of garbage collection.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“So here’s the bad news,” Yao tells Mbetethi. He taps around his tablet, dredging up the consent form for what we’re about to attempt. “We have absolutely no idea what it is that you did to yourself. Homebrew loop-lock systems are dangerous business,” he goes on, with the confidence of someone who just aced an online training module on the topic.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Mbetethi looks at him, then at me, desperate for the good news.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“The good news is that, one, the box on the floor next to you is a piece of neikonautical history. Something like three were ever built, back in the People’s Republic era. And two, our ranking clinician on duty today” — he nods briskly in my direction — “is certifiably insane.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Neither of those things sound like good news. Mbetethi’s mouth curls with horror and despair.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It’s a Deng bridge,” I explain, wincing at the thought of Dr. Deng hearing me say it. Half of everything she’s done since we arrived from Stanford was to distance herself from this machine, all but deny that it ever existed, and here’s her advisee giving out free rides. “It...well, it will let me enter loop-lock with you. We would share a tilespace, sort of, and I could attempt an inversion by hand...in a manner of speaking.” I could go on hedging, but something in the way Mbetethi’s jaw drops fractionally suggests he’s already familiar with the concept — or at least the rumor — of a Deng bridge. When he’s out of this mess, maybe we can talk shop.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I’m going to need you to sign this,” Yao interjects, placing a stylus in Mbetethi’s trembling hand.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Five minutes later I’m reclining in another UTMS scanner that’s been wheeled up next to Mbetethi’s. The Deng Bridge itself is a piece of hardware on the floor between us, wired up with a series of finicky adapters. While Yao runs to the storeroom for a couple of autovials, I turn to our patient and try my hand at the reassuring clinician thing.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I know this is unorthodox. But if it’s any consolation, this is the only thing in the world I’m really good at.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For a long second it’s hard to tell whether Mbetethi even heard this. But then his eyes close and something like an amused smile peeks through the tremors of pain in his face. Yao returns a minute later, and shows our patient a series of fast-acting psychedelic tryptamines like a dentist offering toothpaste flavors. I make note of his selection (the one he groans at the least), but I focus on fitting a tube into the port in the crevice of my elbow. Then I flip the stereo visor over my eyes and begin to configure my own UTMS bed.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Ready?” Yao inquires from the control bank, already sounding distant.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Ready,” I reply, remembering at the last moment to spit out a piece of gum.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“<i>Auuurgh</i>,” notes Mbetethi.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">STAND BY FOR TILES, flashes my visor.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The DMT hits my bloodstream almost immediately. This is the strong stuff, completely overkill for almost anything but a passage through the Deng bridge. It’s like being shot forward on a thousand tiny roller coasters at once, branching, merging and looping around each other in curious ways, all at incredible speed. My being, my <i>I</i>, is squishy, now gelatinous, now molten white-iron pixelated-starfire hot. All around me I hear music like Shephard’s tones in a Phygrian scale, the blackness before my eyes positively blooming with geometry, waves upon waves of soft curves sloshing with neon, the simple truth of myself a womb —</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">And then, from the visor, light. Solid turquoise like the chair God gets his teeth checked in. It fills my field of view so totally, so urgently, that I can’t help but fall into it, bask in its hum, think about what it might be trying to tell me. It’s such a beautiful color, <i>and the next ones must be...orange, maroon, a deep pine.</i> The thought occurs unbidden, and in this precise moment those three colors <i>pop!</i> into my field of view, chorded along with the turquoise across four quadrants of the screen. I open my aperture, letting the message of these colors wash over me, and <i>— pop! —</i> they divide again into nearly the precise pattern I had in mind, and then — <i>pop!</i> — wherever my mind and the computer agree on the next tile it subdivides into four more. Now the pattern on the screen is curious, it seems to rush into me through familiar and deepening grooves, it’s trying to tell me something — if you look at how the colors line up it — <i>pop! </i>— I’m starting to see it now. It all feels very familiar. The tiles, spanning the rainbow in a thousand different shades, are <i>telling</i> me something, if I can just listen in and — <i>pop! </i>— a thousand doubled doublings in a breath’s span, and my visual field is filled with these pixel-fractals waving gently like shoreline trees.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">I feel my consciousness start to extend a little...outward. The tiles are the carrier wave for a mode of thought that’s new? Or just forgotten? And I start to remember the building blocks of this foreign language, impossible nouns and strange verbs clicking together like glossy golden-emerald Lego blocks that build sentences, then whole paragraphs, poems like programs, rhymes like quines. This never gets old. I’m thinking like the computer, and the computer is thinking like me — in billions of tiny symmetries between neurons of my brain and the memristors of the computer’s RAM, something altogether new is beginning to take shape.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Far below I feel my thumb trembling at the controls. It has one last job, just one big dumb button to press — <i>now</i>. Allocation: a glimpse at the magnificent architecture of my new self; raw stimulation of the optic nerve; more color than I can bear. Then my thought loop closes around the computer’s in an immensely satisfying double-knot, and suddenly, spontaneously, I start to <i>compute</i>. Conway’s Games of Life and Lisp interpreters not just abstract concepts that I’d struggle to simulate with pen and paper but concrete and tangible things, arrays of bits that I can see and touch as if with my own hands. The tiles, now solid and high-dimensional but still raggedly geometric, are the medium and the material; I can soar through them just as easily as I can stack them, into beautiful self-assemblages that are both plaything and instruction manual, input and output, thought and code. I have no field of view</span><span class=\"s2\"> — I can see with perfect clarity in all directions at once. This is loop-lock.</span></p>\n</section>",

            "content_html": "<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">For one moment, I'm soaring over a vast, hyperbolic horizon — just enjoying the sensation of forgotten senses coming online and background caches warming to full. I limber up, becoming a ring through which I pass a sphere, which bursts spiky with my heartbeat until it becomes a polyhedron that tessellates across a hyperplane, which I slice into countless layers, overlaying them into a mosaic stretched across my inner light, through which an almost heartbreakingly beautiful proof of the four-color theorem shines. I swoop downwards into a thicket of tubular combinators, piping them together into a machine that rumbles and churns and ejects Merseinne primes like psychedelic parade floats. Okay, still a little stiff, but I'm satisfied that I'm not going to fry myself with a misfired tail call. I push harder on the throttle at the edge of my awareness, retracting my hundreds of appendages into something speedy and compact, and slam through a wall that I just willed into existence like a raindrop hitting a pond.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It would be silly, reductive, to call what's on the other side of this my <i>desktop</i>. It would be borderline profane to call the hyperobjects that populate it, these glassy meteorites from the Platonic realm, <i>files and programs</i>. But this place, a mandala of columns and alcoves and archways, a faintly cotton-candy calm, pulsating with gossamer isomorphisms...it <i>is</i> where I keep the constructs I use the most in tilespace. They burst into view, utterly impossible to imagine down there in soberspace, but utterly unremarkable up here. Many, naturally, are inversion capsules: hefty, translucent carapaces with the eyefeel of quality plastic, some sealed tight and others halfway-reverse engineered, spilling their hypnotically-flashing logical guts. Pre-packaged antidotes to different classes of neikotic debris. A boring day in the clinic involves firing these into patients' minds without entering loop-lock myself.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And more. Spiky, wiry solutions to old problems sets. Lenses and lemmas and lightboxes pigeonholed in a haphazard way that I promise makes sense to me, at least on drugs. Fragmentary subroutines like undulating pasta shapes that look useful, if I could still distinguish their input and output holes. Plenty of the rest are just playthings, little puzzle boxes that radiate humor and astonishment. I should really print a few of these as a treat for my sober self.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A citrus-washed kite of tiles, a string of characters, makes itself known. Yao is trying to communicate with me. The thought from down there is too long in one dimension and utterly flat in all the others. It whips around in the selfhot darkglow of my eta-band currents, crumples under the weight of the shifting tiles. But I know what he’s trying to say: <i>you ready</i>? I drop a simple U+1F44D THUMBS UP downwards in response.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Down there he fiddles with knobs. The Bridge is coming online. A distant wind whistles through me; somewhere, a brand new aperture. I become still, the tiles around me fading from electric blue to faintest periwinkle, and attune myself to a minute pressure differential coming from many distinct directions. I imagine each of these to be a hole in the tiles, opening up and winding into deep darkness. My vista, and my sense of my own shape (for there really is no difference here) becomes birdbone-hollow, pockmarked with wormways. I let the pressure rip me gently and even pleasurably apart through hundreds of these tubes at once. Dark now, but pockmarked with flashes of businesslike luminescence, each of these pathways where I am. A program that Dr. Deng wrote fifteen years ago is operating on me, and it's in my interest not to interfere. For a time I feel large, faint, and very dispersed, so that I can even sense the largest scale of the processor architecture which is massaging me, compacting me — I am beginning to feel small and nearly bullet-like, a shape like the inversion capsules. It comes together very quickly near the end, and spits me out with a <i>thwoop</i>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Not for the first time I wonder if, all those years ago, Dr. Deng could have had any idea how magnificently cliché it would feel to approach the boundary of another mind. The space is cavernous and midnight blue; I am a small, shiny capsule drawn at a measured pace towards the very center of a swirling vortex, a portal-like discontinuity, deep emerald flecked with yellow on the other side. It's impossible to describe almost anything about loop-lock in a satisfying way — but for this in particular, I refer you to <i>Kuayu Yingxiong</i>, a sci-fi blockbuster that came out around when Deng was, like, seventeen.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The portal bulges behind me as I cross. Gossamer strands in my wake pulse with telemetry. The Bridge isn't using very much memory — Deng's terse, infuriating Rust was handwritten for an earlier age — and most of my mind is actually just idling. I play a little trick with my attention: I zoom back outwards so the drama of the probe and the vortex feels like something happening with my index finger. Back in again, so it fills my attention, the rest of my mind a yawning void. Here, thick clouds of deep green tiles surround me, flashing with voxelized thunderclaps of computation. The unknowable thoughts of another mind in loop-lock.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I make my way inwards in my diving-bell shape, curious if Mbetethi can feel me yet.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For a neikonaut accustomed to the wild freedom of solo loop-lock, the Bridge would be a disconcerting, even frightengly constricted experience. And, well, it is. Inside the diving-bell the tiles are mine and mine alone. But they — <i>I </i>— run up quickly against unyielding walls that separate my patient from myself. Briefly I attempt to think thoughts — that is, attempt computations — that run out of tiles and painfully segfault against its pricky-static pixel-hot boundary. Here, the Bridge works tick-by-tick to maintain separation between this little bubble of <i>me</i> and the rest of Mbetethi's mind. It takes a few deep breaths to find my footing in tighter loops and simpler heuristics.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When the capsule starts to feel forgiving, even a little roomy, I push for the boundary again, this time with calibrated effort instead of flailing panic. All I do for a long while is attune myself to the static at our boundary until I start to pick out the unfamiliar rhythm of Mbetethi's mind. <i>It's all wrong! How can he even — </i>but with a practiced burst of intention, I give myself over to the alien logic of his tiles. It's nauseating, then merely uncomfortable...and so on. All I really have to do is sit with it, feeling the Bridge ebb and flow, feeling the boundary blur. Mbetethi's internal logic becomes familiar, then amusing, then even a little endearing, and soon I can play it out for myself. There's phase lag, and plenty of little bursts of static where I get it wrong, but mostly there's a surface where it's hard to say where I end and he begins.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>{{What — impossible — in the fuck did you — ??}}</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">What comes rippling into the capsule could almost be a fragment of my own thoughts.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">{{Y<i>ou're doing great. We can take as long as you need to make sure you're comfortable. What's most important is that you relax. The Bridge is keeping us both safe.}}</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I offer this back, double-stuffed with reassurances and devoid of double negatives, knowing how much will be lost in translation. And for a time, nothing much happens at the boundary. I try to reason out just what this guy<i> </i>does in loop-lock. I sample the hypnotic flashes of his tiles, serialize them up the increasingly narrow strands of self leading back out the Bridge.<i> Yep, he’s a trader.</i> The rest of my mind responds on a long delay as I point myself around like a periscope.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>That’s the contract API for the parallel yuan. Standard stuff.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>That’s a black-market approximation of Paracoin’s L2 forex flow lattice.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>That’s...uh, don’t get any closer to that.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But these are bumps in the dark. mostly I see nothing, unknowability, dark green silt.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>{{ — next?}} </i>After a time Mbetethi seems to have accepted that I'm living in his head, rent-free.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>{{I need freedom to reshape myself. You need to allow my tiles to seep into yours. This happens naturally. You may notice that you've become more comfortable with my patterns of thought.}}</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When they realize this, they always tense up. I brace for the jolt. Some forays with the Bridge fail right here when patients can't get the knack of intentionally sharing tiles, but in a few hundred ticks I feel a loosening. An invitation. I'm impressed, but to say so would only trip him up.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>{{The Bridge will prevent me from growing too large, too quickly, within your mind.}}</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>{{That — — not worried — — all day. Feel way — — than down — }}</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>{{I will keep my movement slow and careful. There is nothing to worry about.}}</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And that's hardly just for his benefit. I barely understand what most of his tiles are doing; I need to move gingerly or I could be zeroed out by a stray allocator. I focus on squeezing myself through dormant blocks of memory, fractal-catacombs that morph just gradually enough for me to keep up.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">{{<i>So what am I looking for?}}</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">These free blocks are a treasure trove of neikotic debris. Halite-crystal chunks of old order books, abandoned state machines bubbling into nondeterminism, even a glimpse of a stray alpha-beta pruner whipping past like a tarantula-boomerang. Mbetethi's way overdue for a cleaning. But these are minor headaches, maybe blurred vision...</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>{{ — — Don't know — hiding — — out here — — away — }}</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Interesting. This tiny slice of Mbetethi at the edge of his mind is either the most cowardly, or the most sensible.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">{{<i>Hmm. Okay. Which way is in?}}</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I bud off a closure: the tiniest, most portable subroutine, containing only this question. Mbetethi's tiles poke and prod, finally executing it as though biting into a battered something at a seaside fry shack. It goes whirring off into his depths...</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>{{ — ah — ooh — — — tickles — }}</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">...and returns triumphantly some kiloticks later, bobbing in the tile mist, inviting me to follow.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">{{ <i>Won't — — listen — reason —}} </i>warns this part of Mbetethi as I disappear into the noise.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Inwards. Trailing this vector-lantern's charted course through the thick, roiling, discretized fog. I've learned a little about the large-scale structure of Mbetethi's thoughts, and in flashes where the clouds part I see sky-high minaret callstacks, ornately geometric coral-reef mandala-trees, buzzing-thrumming event pumps, all in glossy candy-coated brilliance. It's one thing to watch this from the clinic's control bank, to get tantalizing snatches of order flashing across a flat monitor of tiles. To be here, to have been here — it wakes me up sometimes, breath ragged, sweating through the sheets.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">{{ <i>Spectral — dimensionality — fairly — modifications — sieve </i>—<i> }}</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This part of Mbetethi explains what it knows about the debris haunting his mind. The further I go, the more tortured his computation becomes; the tiles form stuttering loops, malformed log-log trees, whole subsystems deadlocked by a broken semaphore (I flip that bit as I pass, and feel tingling waves of secondhand relief.)</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>{{ Standard reduction — minor — escaped garbage — }}</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I gather from these snippets that Mbetethi was trying out a homegrown variant of a dimensionality reduction algorithm. It avoided the cleanup phase at the end of loop-lock, and its rigid edges sunk deep into the soft mantle of his organic mind as he slept.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">{{ <i>Don't — — can still — }}</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Some parts of him are less welcoming, even insistent that I'm wasting my time. The tiles here make me queasy, flashing with checksum errors and timeout exceptions. These crumbly half-finished foundations are pierced through with a dense bramble of pointers, thickening, leading inwards...I can only describe it as a root system. I'm getting close.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">{{ <i>Can handle — — — }}</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The rest is drowned out by pain. The Bridge can't shield me from all of it; the diving-bell buzzes discordantly with every move. The roots are thick and dense here, the bell slashes through them as I pulse ahead, but they grow back in an instant, sizzling through the tiles.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And then I’m flat against it, unyielding, a wall.</p>\n</section>",

            "content_html": "<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">The neikotic debris at the center of Mbetethi’s mind is enormous, but the first thing I notice is its structure at the smallest scale. It’s made of the same jagged tilestuff as its roots, congealed and slower-moving. Its vocabulary of shapes is all sawscrew-corktooth irregularity. Its motion is crepuscular, half-signifying, golden-meaning and onyx-madness. It threatens at once to lash out with its roots, or coil into the interlocking, gyrating Fibonacci spirals that play along its surface. It crawls all over itself.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And it’s reflective. I brush its roughness and it brushes back in the same way, and in its millions of sunflower facets I glimpse the diving-bell’s insectoid hull.<i> </i>It occurs to me that, in loop-lock, thing don't just reflect light. The reflection is something that has to be computed, ray-traced. It takes tiles, cycles, time and energy to do this. Why bother?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I circumnavigate, hewing close as I dare to its roughness, stung now and again by root-whip. This piece of debris (if it can be called that, for it’s larger than anything I’ve ever built in loop-lock) wants to be spherical, but it can’t manage. It’s nothing but caked layers of asymmetry, always sprouting lopsides and frond-probes and petal-eyes. And it’s half-hollow, walnut-ridged, fjordstruck. I can go deep inside.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>{{Hell-o-o-o?}}</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">From outside in, I’ve seen parts of Mbetethi ranging from nonchalant to uncooperative to painfully disjointed. Worming my way into a crack in the debris, I wonder whether I’ll find yet another aspect of him inside. I tell myself it’s safer in here, because it’s where the roots aren’t. But even between narrow, twisting walls of saffronoid tilestuff, they lash out. To hurt me? No. To <i>measure</i> me.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">{{<i>This whole thing came out of loop-lock with you?}}</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I don’t expect him to answer; his tiles keep a quivering, stilted silence in here. (I slither further inwards, already lost in its maze. There’s no turning back now, only inversion). But a clearer picture of the material is coming into focus. Its reaching, measuring, touching is all to create a simpler model of whatever is placed in front of it. Airgapped and quarantined, this is no doubt very useful in financial modeling, but now it’s loose in Mbetethi’s head, and it’s computing a miniature of his mind, inside his own mind. No wonder he’s in pain. In its interlocking shadowgold, I catch another brief glimpse of the diving-bell’s reflection. The bizarre, concentric, interlocking zebra-glyphs flashing lightning-quick across its surface.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>That's me</i>, I realize, feeling strange. <i>That's really me.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So how do I garbage-collect this massive chunk of debris?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The problem is this: for any construct to survive the roiling chaos of a mind on DMT, it has to be self-duplicating, constantly reasserting itself — the <i>loop</i> in <i>loop-lock</i>. I fashion the diving-bell into something dangerous, slashing and hacking at the roots that probe me, but they're back within a few ticks. The part contains the whole, brilliantly, dangerously. Sometimes the solution is slashing faster, hacking harder. I've gotten myself out of any number of jams this way, but here I am too small, deep inside this piece of debris but perhaps still far from the center. I need to interrupt its logic and beat it at its own game. I pause in a relatively cavernous space, dizzy and disoriented, a dozen diving-bells watching from a dozen walls. I let it tickle me for a few ticks.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">How do these roots work?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Their branching is fractal, self-similar. That seems like a promising place to start; a small wedge in their logic could have recursively large effects. I trace a single root away from the walls, though dozens of branches, but I never really find a tip. Its silkent strands fray into the tile noise in apparently random ways to observe Mbetethi's fine structure. This is where the real intelligence of the algorithm is.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Intelligence be damned</i>, I think, bringing one such knot into the diving-bell to sample it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Its microstructure is wild. Insane. I can hardly imagine a neikonaut keeping track of it. The way it intercepts the fundamental update-rules of Mbetethi's tiles is not quite random, but not quite logical either. Or perhaps the logic exists in some higher dimension, with just enough repetition in its shadow to keep me guessing in here. With each tick, the gnarl of pointers reattaches anew to Mbetethi's memory, almost seems to anticipate its changes.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>In fact, it almost seems like...</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A flash of insight, maybe from watching carefully, maybe from up that last silken strand still joined to my larger self. I act. I'm injecting a burst of fibrous taps into the tiny knot, already doing battle now with the finest roots, trying to interfere, to untangle them. I surround whole swathes of its spindles, detaching and garbage-collecting them, a game of Go played tick-by-tick. I can barely keep up as the battlefield grows, the logic becomes too subtle, <i>it </i>surrounds me now — but in a hundred ticks my tingly wildfire has wiped out a volume of the root system the size of the diving-bell, and it grows back slowly enough to watch.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This could be the inversion. I reach in and try again —</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>{{ — — STOP! — — }}</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Mbetethi roars this, unmistakably, into the diving-bell on a wave of raw fear. Now I see what I was missing.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">{{ <i>STOP! — STOP! — — }}</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The debris isn't holding on to Mbetethi at all. He’s holding on, for dear life, to the debris.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">{{<i>It's okay. It's okay! I need you to please calm down.}}</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>{{ — — KILL — BOTH — — ! }}</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>{{Do you feel this?}} </i>I struggle to stay calm against his high tide of viscous panic, directing his attention to a little velcro-knot of pointers where he grasps at the roots. I magnify this structure, flatten it across the diving-bell, playing it on a loop for him to observe.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>{{Do you see what you’re doing? Do you think you could let go?}}</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A long nothing. Now the hair-thin microtubules around me are decoupling, slowly at first and then alarmingly fast. But then, with a whip-crack of tiles, they snap back into place.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>{{ NO. No. No — — can't. No. }}</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>{{Why not?}}</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Four hundred ticks go by. I can sense tiles shuffling, Mbetethi collecting his own thoughts. His response, when it comes, is little more than a magnification of his own silence. Subtle tileflash draws my attention to the diving-bells reflected all over the cavern walls. He says nothing, but his meaning is perfectly clear. <i>What are the odds,</i> he asks, <i>that you’re the real one? What are the odds that I am?</i> The roots are all-permeating, all-measuring. My insides and outs. Nothing mere about these reflections: in the unhollow half of the debris, a toy model of this same conversation is playing out. Me: the diving bell, only even smaller and simpler. Mbetethi: himself, only more panicked and confused.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Or…?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">No heart, no throat, but something very much like all that. A downward semiprime spiral of dread. Mbetethi watching my every move. I press myself up against one of the cavern walls, against the diving-bell reflected therein, and flash a question across my surface tiles. <i>{{What are you like in there. What are you feeling.}} </i>And what else could I possibly expect in return? Yet I linger there against that golden-doppel, knowing that if it’s feeling anything at all, it’s exactly this: this rising panic, this <i>just-what-do-I-really-remember?</i> I press myself against my reflection for a long time. Maybe I’m looking for a telltale lack, a certain simplicity. Or maybe I’m daring it to move first.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>{{Right,}}</i> I finally tell Mbetethi. <i>{{Enough of this. One of two things is true.}}</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>{{One: you’re not the reflection. You let go, the debris disappears, you remain. You survive this.}}</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>{{Two: you are the reflection. You let go, you’re gone, yeah? But you never actually let go. You’re just the thing in the mirror. You never really had the choice.}}</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yeah, of course I know about the third thing.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Judging by Mbetethi’s silence, so does he. But...</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>{{Okay — — try — just — }}</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I give him time enough to change his mind, and a few ticks besides. Then...</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>{{We'll both do it,}} </i>I tell him, expanding the diving-bell, allowing my fringes to succumb to his logic, allowing it to overtake me, offering just the faintest nudges to his tile-paths. His — our — grip on the debris begins to loosen.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>{{If I'm wrong, we'll go together,}} </i>I insist. He insists. No — the distinction is there, but only just...Mbetethi is the willpower, and I'm the detailed grasp of our fine structure. He courses through me in waves, and I feel ourselves untangling tilewise from the root system. I'm growing larger and vaguer now, the diving-bell just a faint membrane between he and I, worming manyways to fill the entire interior of the massive chunk of debris.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The structure of our fear unfurls, revealed in the unmeshing of billions of pointers. The tantalizing impossibility that we could be making the decision to let go from behind the mirror. <i>Because...because...</i>discretized flashes of soberspace memories course through our tiles now — standing in front of mirrors for too long too high too late, watching for <i>something</i>, daring <i>it </i>to happen,<i> it can be true if you believe it</i>. We reach out — not to bloody our hands tonight, but to place a single finger on the surface, pushing hard, willing the bubble to pop.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The unmeshing has reached a critical point. Couldn't stop it if we wanted to. With what's left of the diving-bell I move to encircle the debris, to carry back its shriveled remains. I'm not leaving without my prize. We cut loose a particularly thick segment of roots. {{<i>See? Nothing to worry about,}} </i>we lie to ourselves.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And everything goes black. Maybe I expected it to be more gradual.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But this is how it always goes in here. I don't know if there's sound in loop-lock, exactly, but there's an overwhelming roar of nothingness as the final pointer breaks; for a few ticks we're just decaying chunks of stray tile in a cache. Somewhere on the outside of the mirror, the real diving-bell executes a long-planned, highly-optimized maneuver: it serializes a model of the debris and sends it back up the wire through the Deng Bridge. I go through the same motions in here. Jerky, spidery death throes. Now I am the debris, empty, hollow, thoughtless...just...<i>just</i>.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">On the far side of the Bridge, though, the rest of me has been waiting.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A large, jagged polyhedron of tiles, coal-black and glossy yellow, comes floating lazily out. I send it to the voxelite printer. Once I would stand vigil for the diving-bell, hoping against hope for the strangest kind of reunion; now I slam the Deng Bridge shut with no hesitation. Time to go home. How? Right. <i>Thumbs.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Right thumb.</i> I slam the big dumb button. The drip stops, the tiles become larger, slower, simpler, I can feel my whole being flattened into a single plane of pixelated color, reaching for combinators, lenses, callbacks, pointers, registers and feeling only blind, dumb, organic chaos. Remembering on hard-won instinct not to panic here, <i>it's okay, you'll be back.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I'm blinking. I'm biting hard on my tongue, my whole mouth tastes like iron. The UTMS bed is slick with sweat.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>I can hear the printer running already, constructing a voxelite shard, a death mask of Mbetethi’s debris projected downward into three dimensions. A memento. A desk toy. Contraband. I can never anticipate what these will look like, and yet I'm never, ever surprised.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The visor is black now, save for four softly pulsing characters: <i>INVERSION COMPLETE.</i> I lift it from my face to see Mbetethi staring dumbstruck at me. Freed from a dozen tiny paralyses, his expression looks much more natural now.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"W-w-w-what did you do? What happened in there?\"</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The neikonaut's first and last question. Our oldest and saddest joke. Mbetethi asks through heavy breaths as though he really wants to hear the answer, waits for just a tick, then turns on his heels and flees the clinic without waiting for the punchline.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"I have absolutely no idea,\" I mumble.</p>\n</section>",

            "content_html": "<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Welcome back,” calls Dr. Deng from across the Neikotic Safety floor. Which is odd, because she’s the one who’s been away. One conference after another — I’ve barely seen her all summer. “Let’s take a walk?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dr. Deng and I have begun every semester for the past three years by making each other our priority. We agree that we meet Mondays at nine sharp and take the week from there. And every semester, nine becomes ten thirty, ten thirty becomes <i>after lunch</i>, which gradually, torturously becomes <i>try and find me in the building, I dare you</i>. By December we’ll be lucky if we’re on speaking terms. But today is September 3 and she’s smiling, holding a coffee with my name on it. I’ll take it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Let’s take a walk,” I concur. And again to Deng’s credit, she says nothing about the little voxelite shard she caught me fidgeting with. Neikotic debris from Mbetethi, freshly printed and still uncategorized. We take Deng’s way, out of the Safety wing and through the little basement annex of the Neikotic Theory department, and I find we’re not the only ones getting an early start. You can <i>smell</i> these guys breaking loop-lock into its constituent parts, with their dry-erase markers and little mothball hits of DMT. In the oblique, dusty silence they keep, you can hear its shell crack gently. At a whiteboard covered in commutative diagrams, a chain-smoking postdoc cusses reverently under his breath.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“So, Busan?” I venture, once we’re in the elevator. I hiss inwardly at the glorious morning sunshine.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Busan,” Deng concurs. Behind her severe ponytail and ovoid rimless glasses, I imagine gears whirring, even in the most casual of conversations, trying to find the...crispest thing to say. “They’ve invested a frightening sum into neikotics. A second hub for the field, Shanghai without all the <i>interesting</i> bits, that’s what they imply. A bloodless twin on the operating table. You should have come.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“And what do you think of it?” I ask, biting my tongue. I would have come, with more than four hours’ notice.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I think it’s good to be home.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Out of the elevator, into another glassy mainsail of a building, past a cafeteria churning with undergrads — still an introduced species here, still clambering for a niche. Three years ago — hell, three months ago — the Yangtze Institute for Neikotic Studies was under construction. It was a freakshow of acidheads and gremlins and category theorists converging timidly from Fudan and Tsinghua and Hong Kong University, blinking in the LED track lighting. Now it sells hoodies. <i>My Son Is A (Provisional) Neikonaut.</i> It’s a school<i>.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Despite all that’s gone down between us, it’s nice to see Dr. Deng. Next week she starts teaching for the first time since we left Stanford together, and the woman — thirty years my senior and a titan of neikotics — is nervous. <i>What if they hate me, </i>she wants to know, and I brush that off as impossible. As a lecturer, she’s magnetic. I tell her this; she smiles. Our last conversation of any length, on my boneheaded failure to grasp Lam fibration, feels distant now. But it’s like this every year: fall semester, new prospects, a fresh start. By the spring, our relationship is in tatters.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Then we round a corner into Building 2 and —</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Mona, should we...”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I realize what’s in the corridor. Or should I say <i>on</i>, on the just-installed floor-to-ceiling displays?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“No,” I mutter, stealing just a tiny glance before fixing my eyes straight ahead. “It’s okay.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This hallway is long and narrow, newly reoopened last week. It’s walled by two floor-to-ceiling displays which bathe us in white and blue light as we pass through. In my peripheral vision I try not to notice details: the soap-bubble sheen of the crystaline cavern walls, the stoplight pinwheels and traffic-cone snailshells, the honeycomb maze of <i>their</i> world refracting through. It’s daytime in Shanghai, and so it’s daytime in the Mirror Sea: it blooms languidly with the shapefeel of taxis and snack carts and great magnolia trees, though I know close inspection would reveal a shifting tapestry of suggestion and no discrete objects whatsoever. To our right, a Ripple wriggles along at roughly our speed, but I react not at all. Not by changing pace, and especially not with a tiny, sharp intake of breath.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">On the other side, Deng tuts: “They really shouldn’t be putting more of these up. People are sensitive.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She’s sticking up for me, but it rankles. “It’s on a time delay. Totally Weather Bureau-compliant. I’m fine.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You’re doing your belief modulation exercises?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Every day.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She steers us on a long meander through YINS’ hexagonal quad, keeping to the shade and primly ignoring stares from the more well-read freshmen: <i>that’s Deng Jinghan! And some ratty grad student! </i>But she can’t fool me. I know what day it is, and I know the general direction we’re heading. I play along through the small talk, all the way into drafty Building 5, where echoes rise and our voices drop. She slows near some enormous mahogany doors, inlaid with wink-nudge stained glass mandalas. <i>What are the odds? </i>say her eyebrows. <i>Should we have a peek?</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It’s time for my yearly lecture in the Hall of Eggs. I roll my eyes hard and follow her inside.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There are a smattering of tourists in here, and several rows of glass shelves, and thousands of volts of electricity between us and their contents. Deng falls museum-silent as we pass under a body scanner, and we contemplate in silence. Neikotic eggs are intricate, vaguely spherical little gizmos, printed in all the colors and refractivities that voxelite can be coaxed to take on. Their puzzle-box mechanisms and bizarre unfurlings are messages from a neikonaut in loop-lock to their future self. Stuck with a breakthrough too immense to lug back to consensus reality, this is the first line of defense: printing an object that, pondered or fidgeted with, will lead the sober mind to the same insight. Textbook-wise, they’re TSPs, tangible soberspace projections. But everyone just calls them eggs.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Mona,” Dr. Deng mutters eventually, eyes fixed on a little rhomboid of cerulean voxelite labeled <i>A low-cost manufacturing technique for strontium-alloy superconductors</i>. “We need to start thinking about your dissertation.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I expected her to meander further to this point, loudly admiring the PhD-worthy eggs of former colleagues or students. In past years, this had been her way of reminding me whose company I was in.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I sort of gulp, sort of sigh. “I know.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“This is your fourth year at YINS. Now that doesn’t put you <i>behind</i>, exactly. But I look at what you’ve been spending your time on here, and I worry about your prospects for graduating...not just on time. At all. Now,” she rushes to add, “I don’t put this all on you. There was no real neikotics department at Stanford, and I considered their cognitive science curriculum an unhelpful distraction. You’ve had plenty to catch up on. The language, the culture, too. I think we can chalk up your incident last year as a kind of acclimation sickness to Shanghai.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I catch her eye in the glass and she pauses to let me add to this list. And in years past I would have let her have it: I would have told her straight up that she may be a magnetic lecturer, but she could be an absentee, forgetful, and even condescending advisor. That she had a way of dangling the mathematics I needed to know just out of reach. That I may not know much, but even <i>I</i> could tell her research program was a garden path to nowhere, a maze of distractions and abstractions tolerated only because she might one day snap to her senses and resume work on what everyone really wants from her, the thing she dangles above the whole field of neikotics: a fully operational Deng Bridge.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I want this to work,” I tell her instead. All those older feelings, they roll harmlessly in my gut, their sharpness smoothed by time and combat. “I really do. But I’m starting to think I’m never going to find it in me to care about the Loop-Lock Virtual Machine, about compiler invariants and higher-order fragment lifetimes, about...y’know...”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“About my research,” Dr. Deng finishes, with a sheen of amusement. “I think you’ve made this very clear by now, one way or another. And Mona...” She loves to buy herself another second by drawing out these two syllables. “I ought to say that I might have picked up on this sooner. I wasted <i>your</i> time, wondering why I had to chase you down, year after year, for every paragraph or diagram or line of code. Perhaps I was asking the wrong question.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I almost can’t believe what I’m hearing.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“But you could have <i>just told me!</i>” she insists. “Just said once, ’I’m not interested in compilers.’ So easy!”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I...” I feel myself going red, grasping for the right words, never finding them on the spot. This is how all of our fights start. Deng follows up something mild and reasonable with some left hook, something she just couldn’t keep to herself, and then...<i>what happens next, Mona? You say the first stupid thing that comes to mind.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So I just let it echo until, improbably, she backs off. “I’m sorry. That wasn’t right to say.”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I must look incredulous. Deng crinkles her eyes as if to say: <i>you think you’re tired of fighting? I’m twice your age.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Let me see if I can do this quick. See, Deng <i>discovered</i> neikotic debris, back in the bad old days at Fudan University or the People’s Liberation Navy or whatever. She came up with the mathematics that wipes it from our minds. And, one day, she decided it was a lost cause. She abandoned years of research and declared that her new goal was to prevent the Loop-Lock Virtual Machine from generating any debris to begin with. This would be a simple matter of unfurling an endless toolbelt of category theory and applying it to the most complicated<i> </i>computer program in existence.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">On her invitation, without a degree, I left Stanford! To come and help!</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I am interested in compilers,” I finally conclude out loud. “Just not in a, five years plus the rest of my life kind of way. And I wanted to contribute. Because you’re right. Obviously it’s better to prevent neikotic debris in the first place, instead of inverting it away later. And admitting that I still want to do that, that I still like the clinical side, well, it felt stupid to say. It felt like you’d be disappointed in me.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Deng smiles wistfully, and it occurs to me that, although I’ve played this conversation out a hundred times in the shower, she’s hearing this for the first time. This moment feels so raw, so real, that I want to shake her and insist, <i>don’t you see what you’ve done to me?</i> <i>Don’t you understand how low you’ve made me feel, for so many years, for struggling up this impossibly steep trail you think you’ve blazed?</i> For a moment I swear we’re right there together. But now she composes herself and says what she prepared to say, probably also in the shower.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You’re the first student I ever took on, and I thought...I thought...” She hardens herself. “To be honest, when I returned to Shanghai, after all those years, I thought it should have been obvious. I thought that a city brimming with neikonauts, in a way that I used to dream about, would want to hear that neikotic debris is not inevitable. I had heard the horror stories, from a distance, and I thought that neikotic safety would be a major concern. I <i>am</i> disappointed, Mona, but not in you. I’m disappointed that all of <i>this” </i>— she gestures vaguely at the shelves of eggs — “comes with so much needless pain.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I feel it too.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“And I know that’s why you spend much time in the Neikotic Safety clinic. Whatever I said.” Whatever she said, in the last weeks of last April, had been biting. Venomous. <i>If all you want to be in this life is a clinician</i>, it began, and I drowned the rest in booze and tryptamines and the tiles, parked right at the ledge that so many of the city’s neikonauts find themselves tumbling over. And now, unbelievably, I hear my own insistences in her voice. “And there’s something very selfless about that.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You said it’s a waste of my time.” I don’t quite mean to throw her words back at her; my voice is soft, hesitant. “A waste of my <i>mind</i>, a waste of<i> rare neikotic instinct.</i>”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I meant your use of the prototype. It’s dangerous. It’s not a toy.” It’s never <i>the Bridge</i>, and never ever <i>the Deng Bridge</i> with her. Always<i> the prototype.</i> “And I stand by some of what I said. What you do in the clinic helps one person, once, at incredible risk to yourself each time. And I worry that instead of tools, or replicable protocols, you’re looking for a thrill. I worry that it makes you a little too interested in the debris itself.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I laugh ruefully, feeling the voxelite shard in my pocket, the husk of the thing I found writhing in Mbetethi’s mind. “I don’t see where you’d get that idea.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Deng smiles a little, but she folds her arms and drums her fingers. “I can’t keep fighting you on how much neikotic debris you print from your own budget. But others in the Neikotic Safety department find it perverse. And they talk. You should know that.” By the end of this, her tone is loud and insistent enough to produce hissing echoes around the high ceiling of the Hall of Eggs. She glares daggers at a pair of rubbernecking, Polaroid-wielding Japanese tourists, but modulates her voice. “I’m sorry. I don’t want to turn this into another of our fights.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I regard her a little sadly. “So what’s different this time?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Deng is so ready for this one that she starts counting on her fingers. “<i>I </i>am going to stop insisting that you share my own interest in compiler-level safety guarantees. I will stop insinuating to you that neikotic debris removal is a <i>tu lao wu gong</i> dead-end research avenue, and if that’s what you want to focus on, I will remove every obstacle in your path. I will be rooting for you to prove me wrong.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I simply cannot believe what I’m hearing. The sudden, unmetered warmth in Deng’s face illuminates her features in a way I’ve never seen. God! Maybe she had a particularly good psilocybin freetrip in Busan, or some spa there finally cracked her upper back into alignment. But her usual stern, weary, vaguely quizzical expression returns just as suddenly, the warmth receding to its fringes. She begins to count on her other hand.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“And, for your part, it’s time for you to start treating what you do in the clinic as the seeds of a serious research program. Whatever you choose to do with your time at YINS...well, it needs to start building to something. It’s not for me to tell you exactly what that means, but...”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Less time working with the Bridge?” I surmise.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Is what I would suggest. Take a step back, if you can, from the problems of individual patients. You don’t need to save every single person who walks in. Start looking for patterns, start seeing trends...”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It irks me a little that this is just what I’ve been doing with my collection of neikotic debris, a project that Deng has decried over and over as wasteful, childish, and even profane. But our one endless argument is made of tiny loops, smaller, interlocking bickerings. She’s trying to break some. I can break others. <i>Let it go.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“...and I think you could stand to spend more time in the Soup, staying abreast of the literature. They <i>are</i> doing a lot of interesting work in Busan these days. I ran into an old colleague from Goettingen there, she works on encapsulation theory, I think you two should get on a call...”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Suddenly the dim, reverent silence of the Hall of Eggs is broken by an obnoxious <i>bee-dee-deep! Bee-dee-deep!</i> I look up, down, left, and right before I realize that the target of a few nasty glances is me. I’m getting paged.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“...I had a note to mention. I’d like you to pick up Kasibar and Kuang and work through some of the exercises in the last three chapters this semester...”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She’s starting to run out of fingers.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Dr. Deng!” I insist, finally interrupting her spiel, waving my blinking card in her face. “That...I agree with everything you’ve said. Truly. But they need me down in the clinic!”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Oh. Oh!” She smiles widely, intentionally, to reinforce the freshness of this particular fresh start. <i>That’s a good thing now.</i> “Right. Go do your thing.”</p>\n</section>",

            "content_html": "<section>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There was no Neikotic Safety clinic at YINS until the year I arrived. </span><span class=\"s2\">So how it already seems so timelessly dingy downstairs beggars belief. <i>Someone</i> had to choose these low ceilings, this distressingly creamy paint color, these oddly faithful LED simulacra of fluorescent bulbs. It was presumably someone else who then decided to deck it out like a Palo Alto strip-mall spa, with bonsai plants, little self-contained waterfalls, and beaded curtains where in my opinion there should be doors. Dr. Deng has nicked half a dozen salt lamps from down here — first for her office and later, I suspect, as last-minute birthday gifts — and yet more continue to appear. Sunk deep into a fat couch in the lounge one day, Yao finally figured it out: the instructions had, naturally, been to decorate for a psychedelic therapy clinic.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">On the wall of the waiting room is a faux-neon tangle of lines which can be lit individually to present a surprising variety of truisms in caoshu<i> </i>calligraphy. Today’s is, essentially, <i>count your blessings</i>. And underneath, each sulking in a different corner of the room, are three neikonauts — perhaps one more than we treat on an average day. I recognize that stare that can’t quite focus, the way their cheeks twitch involuntarily; I try to make eye contact and they can’t quite lock on. So I cast a not-so-subtle glance at their puffy vests, their lanyards, and their messenger bags. Each of them, somewhere, bears the stylized-lock insignia of Suowei Financial.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">I wave tentatively as I weave between them — “Hello!” — and receive a disheartening chorus of low groans in response. Around the corner and through one of the damnable beaded curtains, is Yao Tongduan, tending to yet another Suowei employee. The tiles pulsing violently on the monitor show him repeatedly entering and exiting loop-lock. Yao is throwing every inversion in the book at him, and once every five seconds the scanner makes a delightful <i>zwoop! </i>These make the neikonaut’s legs dangle and dance, but are otherwise ineffective.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">“Vest types,” I note mildly to Yao by way of a greeting. I’m starting to feel like I’ve been here before.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">“Oh, <i>po ge dan</i>, Mona. Can you work another miracle?”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">“You’re doing shifts yourself already?” I ask, impressed, and also deflecting the question of whether I’m ready to break out the Deng Bridge — ahem — <i>the prototype,</i> right this minute.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">“Dr. Rui’s on the clock too. But you know how the profs are. They stop by, they sign the log, they leave.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">In fact, Dr. Deng has not even deigned to visit the Neikotic Safety clinic in several months, and there are empty grid squares where her name should be. I try to imagine what she’d say in this situation, aside from something about Suowei’s horrendously, acrobatically unsafe fork of the Loop-Lock Virtual Machine that does away with all of her patches.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">“Well, okay. Have you done intake? What were they working with?”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">“<i>I don’t know/decline to say.</i> All of ‘em.” Our most hated checkbox on the intake form. But retaining memories from loop-lock is so hard that this option is probably checked more than any other. I make a disappointed little <i>pfft</i> sound, but Yao looks oddly, almost conspiratorially, delighted.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">“What?” I ask, suddenly very curious.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">“Isn’t it obvious?” he says, in his isn’t-it-obvious voice. “For one thing, why do you suppose they’re not at Suowei’s own clinic? With the gold trim and the cucumber water? They could be in and out with a fire-cupping to boot, but they trekked up here instead. It’s not <i>I don’t know</i>, Xu<i> </i>xuejie, it’s <i>decline to say!</i>”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">Annoyingly, it is obvious. “They’re using something way off the Suowei playbook, huh.” I lower my voice, though our patient couldn’t possibly hear us. “Something black-market, something their managers would never approve of.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">“They’re passing proprietary trades through some ten-ping egg from a Plaza 66 discount bin,” Yao snickers, his imagination running a little wild. “Look at them out there. They all look guilty as hell! Won’t even look at each other!”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">This I had also noticed. Out there in the waiting room they’re spaced as far from each other as possible.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">“So...” he intones, glancing at the closet where we keep the Bridge. “You wanna get in there?”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">Yes, desperately. But not as badly as I want to stay on Deng’s good side.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">“I dunno, man. I’m still a little loopy from last week.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">“You think <i>I</i>...” he begins, sounding overtly casual.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">“Oh, hell no.” Even Fresh Start Deng will flay me alive if I start training undergrads on the Bridge. My thoughts linger on Mbetethi Okeme, who absconded without telling us anything about the algorithm that got him in hot water. I could totally see <i>him</i> trying out a mystery-box egg from Plaza 66. Maybe even selling them. I snap my gum thoughtfully. “Mind if I take the wheel here?”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">Yao lends me his chair. I tap my card to retrieve an enigmatic folder in my home directory called <i>One-Offs.</i> Of its fifty-odd entries, the latest is just a few days old and bears Mbetethi’s name. I didn’t know what else to call it.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">“These are...” Yao begins.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">“One-offs, I know.” A loading bar grinds away. “But I’ve got a hunch.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">A recording of Mbetethi’s loop-lock session appears. I click through a cascade of beige dialog boxes. <i>Inspect. Isolate. Bandpass. </i>I slap my own Kasibar coefficients into a text box, and a considerable amount of color onscreen is filtered away. <i>Tools. Bicubic smoothing. Smooth (1-100).</i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">“No kidding,” Yao mutters.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">“Pick a number,” I tell him.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">He thinks for a second, and picks twenty-seven. “Wait, no! Twenty-three.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">The isolated, bandpassed, smoothed blob on screen is the diving-bell, the little bubble of tiles that I rode through the Deng bridge into Mbetethi’s mind. I try not to think about the fact that it’s also a Boltzmann brain, a chunk of myself that will burst into existence with a fully-formed, well, something. I frown and muck with the smoothing some more. What’s left looks passably like any of the other inversion capsules that Yao has been firing into our patient.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><i>File. Save. File. Import.</i> The <i>zwoop</i> sounds cease. A big green button appears, but for a while, I only stare at the white-hot tangle of debris on the UTMS readout. A hollow, broken, hyperspherical shell crawls all over itself, sending arc-whips into our patient’s ‘folds. There is a cheery <i>can’t hurt!</i> very much stuck in my throat.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">“Doooo it,” Yao whispers behind me.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">The inversion happens so fast, it’s only an afterimage. A tiny striped jet flashed twice in hair-thin orbits around the debris. Then it met one of its arc-whips and, starting from this extremum, simply ripped it apart. Literally, I blinked, and now it’s gone. In tilespace, a dozen frantic diagnosis threads rush into the jagged vacuum it leaves, stitching it with mauve. But my eyes are on the neikonaut in the chair: his entire body relaxes, and he lets out a groan of relief that’s frankly almost obscene.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">“I think it worked,” Yao observes, poorly containing a snort of laughter.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">“No kidding,” I mutter.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">The debrief is not very informative for anyone. On the comedown, our patient beams at us — no, me specifically — </span>like some kind of dorm-room freetripper. He’s got <i>that</i> look, head shaven, the sigils winding in tight loops down his arm, the black and billowy tentcloak I suspect he’d have trouble pitching if it came down to it. But by the time he climbs out of the chair, he’s sullen and reticent, unwilling to say anything about what neikotic techniques left this debris behind. Which is just as well, because I’m quite reluctant to say how we removed it.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“It’s <i>proprietary</i>,” he insists in a tone just brimming with apology and gratitude. “Am I cleared to go?”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Yao wipes down the scanner chair, and I know I should help out, but I’m almost frozen by the shock of what just happened. The inversions that the Deng Bridge produces are, as a rule, one-offs. I’ve tried this smoothing business before with no results — otherwise there’d be a paper out with my name on it, or at least a Mona-shaped hole in Deng’s wall.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">Now Yao peeks at his clipboard and shouts another name into the waiting room, but the head that pokes through the beaded curtain is just older than middle-aged, with faint waves of permanent worry cresting on its brow. Dr. Rui Zhang stoops into the room, looking a little too tall for the clinic’s doors, and also for the midnight-purple YINS tracksuit pulled taut to his wrists. He looks, as he always does, surprised by something in the middle distance that no one else can quite make out.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Oh! Dr. Rui!”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Yao <i>tongxue</i>,” he regards our young Yao somewhat airily, fishing for a pen in his waist pack. “And Xu as well. You know there’s no overtime pay, right?” He chuckles to himself. “Sometimes I wonder.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“She came down to help with a new inversion,” Yao explains, and I do rather think he’s beaming at me, his senior classmate.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Is that so?” Rui looks up from the logbook, glances at the closet where the Deng Bridge is stowed, and then back to me. I give him a smile like a shrug. “Mind if I take a peek?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The next Suowei employee finds her way in, bumping into walls. She arrived complaining of <i>intensely painful golden light at center of being</i> due to <i>don’t know/decline to say.</i> We cluster into the control bank, wondering if what just happened was a fluke or something more. It takes longer this time, almost thirty seconds, but my new inversion binds flawlessly. Rui peers at its spectrum, making little <i>hrmm</i> noises, oblivious to the patient we help out of the chair. “So is this some clever trick with Lam fibration?” He clicks his pen in my direction, and, caught in his headlights, I can only stare. “Ah, quite right, that wouldn’t....” He mumbles. “Temporal smearing in the binding graph preimage, perhaps?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Using none of those words, I recount the story of where the inversion came from. Rui’s eyebrows flee, caterpillar-like, up his forehead in surprise. Here I grasp for details of what I actually did in loop-lock, which only serves to stir them further in my memory.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“But that’s never worked before,” he insists quietly. Then, as though rearranging the sentence might dispel the mystery, he declares, “Never before has that worked. Deng won’t be happy to hear that old box has a new lease on life, I can say that much. So it <i>was </i>the temporal smearing, then?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I...well, no!” The idea of Dr. Rui Zhang, the world’s foremost authority on soberware, eyeing me as a mathematical prodigy is both deeply amusing and not a ruse I can keep up for long. “It’s just something I did. I don’t really know how.”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">But he smiles wryly. “You know, Lam herself used to say something similar. <i>Math is what happens in the moment</i>. Don’t sell yourself quite as short as that.” It looks like he wants to say something else here — the worst part of me is hoping for a dig at Dr. Deng — but then he thinks better of it. “I think that between you and Mr. Yao, the situation here is under control. But, interesting...interesting...”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">As Rui hastens off in a kind of speed-walk, Yao turns to me and mutters: “could have applications to soberware.”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">It’s not Dr. Rui’s fault that his whole subfield is the butt of one of YINS’ favorite jokes. I mean, okay, it kind of is. Maybe he shouldn’t have stood up and asked about <i>applications to soberware </i>at so many guest lectures and thesis defenses. Yet I have a vague sense that the undergrads aren’t allowed to find it funny. I’m about to insist to Yao with a half-straight face: <i>That man is a luminary!</i> But then our next patient loses his balance, grabs for one of the curtains, and sends a hailstorm of rainbow-colored voxelite beads clattering to the floor.</span></p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So I hand him the reins, and take to sweeping beads out from under the EASL arrays, coolant reserves, and the tryptamine cabinet. From the corner of my eye I can see a few new sullen, stubbly heads bobbing in the waiting room. “Isn’t it weird,” I ask once we’ve shot our next patient into higher dimensions, “how they’re all sat so far apart from one another? Are they scared they’ll be seen by someone on their team?”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“Suowei is <i>ruthless</i>,” Yao replies, sounding more awed than scared. “I’ve heard they set up these honeypots. They stash unclaimed ping at internal addresses you can only see if you turn off their tileguide. They leave juicy-looking eggs in the cafeteria fridges that burn up your neikotic channels for weeks. That kind of thing. And they make you sign the ping chain with an admission of guilt on your way out, otherwise you get fucked by their Bloom filters forever.”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">His theory goes out the window when the next patient turns out to work for Paracoin.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">After lunch, I’m supposed to attend a seminar on <i>Causal Dipole Manipulation via Ephaptic Coupling: The Neural Basis for Loop-Lock. </i>But, fun though it sounds, my curiosity gets the better of me. Instead I spend the afternoon reviewing intake forms, calling out names, and swabbing temples with electrode gel. If they all had the same symptoms, I’d probably let it go. But each of them presents with something completely different. And yet my inversion works on all of them.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Case study: Wang Yi, age twenty-three. Employer, Suowei Financial. Presents with —</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“Y’know when you have unreachable rollups after using Tenfold Gate? It feels kinda like that. Tingly, <i>tingly</i> in my fingers.” He grits his teeth through what sounds like a very unpleasant sensation. “And my toes.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He’s actually wearing the purple-and-gold Suowei neikosuit under his dress shirt and chinos, and looks a little disappointed when, starting to undress, we tell him the inversion will only take a few minutes.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Cause of debris: <i>unknown/decline to say</i> — “It’s my second day at this job,” he pleads.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">After each run, the diving-bell quietly drops a .vxl file into my home directory. I peek at what was collected from Wang’s mind: a corkscrew bolus, a pasta shape from the forever realms. Structurally it scarcely resembles what I extracted from Mbetethi, but it has the same onyx-and-gold sheen. And when I look at it, I feel the same crawling, grabbing spiraling texture behind my eyes.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Case study: Gu Xiangyu, age twenty-nine. Employer, Chaoyue Labs. Presents with —</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“<i>Auuguh chumoo geryoou...”</i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This is a serious case, as bad as Mbetethi’s. Her hand shakes as she fills out the form, her expression desperate and pleading. We let her skip all the checkboxes and bring her to the front of the line. But five minutes later, she barely bothers to look at us. “I really can’t tell you anything,” she insists, pulling on a heavy black overcoat against the warm September sun. “I’d expect that you hear that every day.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Her debris is in a classic, even stereotypical shape: a jagged rectilinear pileup, dense with crystalline lines. But the texture and color mark it as a byproduct of the same mysterious algorithm. I limit myself to a peek at each of these, and force myself not to wonder how they’d look in voxelite. How I ought to categorize them.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Case study: Bui Thien An, age twenty-five. Employer, Paracoin Technologies Limited...</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">By midafternoon, the last of them is gone. Yao peers into the minifridge and lobs a Tsingtao at me.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“So this is good for at least an acknowledgement, right?”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I’m a little distracted by the salt lamp casting dim orange light from the lounge end-table. It’s hard not to see it as a chunk of neikotic debris, and to wonder what it would feel like to have it lodged, dull and bulbous and a little sharp, into my unconscious mind. “Whaddaya mean?” I respond, after a pause.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“I mean your <i>paper</i>, Mona.” He sounds half deferential, half astounded by my boneheadedness. “The one that you’re gonna write about this new class of debris, and your amazing new inversion for it? <i>Thanks also to my trusted pal Yao Tongduan?</i>”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A paper hadn’t occurred to me at all, and a sort of chibi Dr. Deng appears in my mind to hector me for this. “I...well, yeah! I don’t see why not. Only we’d need to be able to infer something about the egg that produced it.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“I oughta be able to...” Yao muses. Prodding his rollscroll, he peruses the fingerprints of the debris we removed: spectra, and eigenvalues, and impulse responses — but never, I notice, an actual model of the debris itself. “I mean, I’d <i>better</i>, with my exam on Thursday...” He gradually falls silent, takes a long sip from his Tsingtao, and sighs.</span></p>\n</section>",

            "content_html": "<section>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Over email, and well into the early morning, Yao treats me to more theories on the source of the new debris. But turning them over, I find they all omit a key figure. It was inside Mbetethi Okeme’s mind that I had computed the inversion, and I try inserting him into Yao’s gradually more unhinged speculations to see how he fits. Had he stolen the egg from one of Suowei’s honeypots? Was he leaving it outside the Suowei Tower for their more gullible neikonauts to find? The rhythm of Mbetethi’s tiles buzzes into my half-sleep, and I wake from a frantic sense of trying to match them, to write loops and build monads in his logic. We <i>conversed</i> in there, I could be sure of it — or at least, he spoke to the part of me that had crossed into him via the Bridge. Maybe he explained the egg quite clearly in there. But whatever he said, it’s now lost to me across two yawning chasms — one between waking life and loop-lock, and another between myself and the diving-bell.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I arrive early to the clinic the next morning and make a beeline for the first scanner bay, looking for something overlooked. All through my unsleep, I saw it clearly in my mind’s eye. And — <i>nice</i> — it’s still here: Mbetethi’s N-1 lanyard, still dangling inconspicuously from a swivel chair. I pocket it and hang around, waiting for patients. It’s never more than a trickle, but the waiting room is never empty. Joining yesterday’s Big Three traders are employees of smaller firms, and even one or two of what Yao called “lone wolves”. He’s not in today. But unbelievably, Deng is.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">After lunch, I find her preparing a Paracoin trader for loop-lock. For an uncooperative or unresponsive patient, this can be quite an ordeal — we have to recover their Kasibar calibration polynomials from what amount to full-bore magnetic depth charges. His impressive loadout of piercings is laid a safe distance away from the scanner head.<i> “Clear!”</i> shouts another clinician, and the display briefly lights up with a spider-map of his neikotic channels.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">“You sorry sons of dogs!” shouts the man in the scanner. His eyes meet mine for a moment and I feel beheld, even grasped, by the madness behind them. “Do you have any idea who I work for?”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">“He forgets where he is,” Dr. Deng explains dryly. “He thinks we’re trying to hotwire him.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Every neikonaut ever to hold court in a booth at Double Descent claims to know a guy who was drugged, dragged, and sent into loop-lock, forced to execute some proprietary algorithm for nefarious ends. The perps vary: it might be a Taipei-trained splinter cell, or Chalkers, or just a jealous manager from down the hall. Verified reports are scarce, but this is why we don’t just carry our Kasibar coefficients on, like, a medical card.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The man in the scanner dry heaves, and I scramble for a trash can.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">“So you did this with the prototype.” Once our patient is sedate, between the <i>bzzzzt </i>and the <i>zwoop</i>, Deng turns to face me with an inscrutable expression. I’d been waiting for the right time to explain all this to her, but she knew the whole story by the time I arrived.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">“Last week,” I insist, by way of excuse. “Before —”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">But she’s not indignant; merely surprised, and maybe, actually, impressed. “Well.” She exhales. “It’s more good than I ever did with it.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>And that is that</i>, her tone suggests. A comfortable, businesslike silence descends between us, as we swab and soothe and stabilize one quantitative analyst after another. Only an hour later does she glance at some readouts for a moment, scrunch her nose, and declare, “it must be some kind of spectral sieve.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">“The egg?”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">“The egg,” she confirms. I’m about to ask, <i>how could you possibly know that?</i> But I resolve to take up her challenge and, armed with the answer, scramble back down the trail of her reasoning. Another hour hence, our scanner’s overheated beamformer dies. She peeks through the doorway and cups her hands. “If you work for Suowei, Paracoin, or Chaoyue,” she shouts, “please seek treatment from your employer! We’ve put our inversion online, and your facilities are better than ours.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Some stand to leave. Others stow their lanyards. <i>“Do you know who that is?”</i> whispers one trader to his frigidly unresponsive neighbor. <i>“That’s Adrianna Lam!”</i></span></p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>I know I’ve seen these shapes before.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Deng is gone at five — <i>off to be wined and dined</i>, she explains, hopping on one foot from the restroom, jamming the other into a flat. Once a month or so, some enterprise catches wind that Deng Jinghan is back in Shanghai and makes discrete and dimly-lit inquiries about whether she might, properly motivated, see fit to build another Bridge. She deflects these and does what she can to parlay them into enormous, unrestricted grants for the Neikotic Safety department. And, hey, we do need a new beamformer.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Any plans for the evening?” she asks mildly, clipping on an earring.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I’m — uh, just going to take it easy.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She looks at me a little sadly as if to say, <i>don’t get carried away.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I ride up to the voxelite fab on the sixth floor of Building 3. Great translucent tubes descend from the ceiling. A handful of neikonauts pace between them, waiting for their eggs to finish printing, hoping that today’s loop-lock session might have been the big one. On the wall, between chemical hazard symbols and laser warnings, the largest chiding of all reads simply, <i>NO PEEKING! </i>At an open workstation, I tap my card and dump my home directory into the printer. <i>Clink! </i>My first job is done in fifteen seconds. <i>Clunk!</i> I get a glance or two from around the room. <i>Clink! Clunk!</i> My prints pile up in the tray. Someone glances quizzically my way, no doubt wondering what kind of neikotic egg comes in dozens of small pieces. I scoop my prints surreptitiously into a black shopping bag and stride away.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The acrid, vaguely metallic smell of the fab follows me back into the elevator. “<i>Ai — zhu ni ge hao dan!</i>” Someone wheeling in a cart of priceless-looking optical arrays catches a whiff, smiles knowingly, and wishes me<i> good egg!</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I can no longer fit my collection of neikotic debris in a single bin beneath my desk. This summer, while Dr. Deng was away, I moved it to one of the underused metal cabinets along the walls of the Neikotic Safety floor, and locked it for good measure. Nobody’s asked so far. Flinging open the doors, I find three giant plastic tubs, themselves partitioned into dozens of cubbyholes. I heave them onto my desk, and then considering Deng’s warning — <i>people talk </i>— move them to an empty conference room and frost the windows.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>I know I’ve seen these shapes before.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Some pieces of neikotic debris are undeniably, gloriously unique. These are the gems of my collection, tucked into cubbies of honor, in tiny street-powder gram baggies. But I could never ignore the similarities in the grotesque, hyperreal shapes I’ve unlodged from minds over the years. Most of my prints clink around in categories that fill larger, even gallon-sized ziplocks. The problem is the categories; you can read the story of my failures from scribbled-out masking tape labels. The first bag I reach for used to be <i>#11 [ominous/fibrous/trapezoidal]</i>, but is now <i>#56 [warm/wet grooves/oblong]</i>. The next is <i>#70 [involuted-pinwheels~careful!]</i>. With them all laid onto the long table, I consider my latest haul.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">These new prints, still warm, glow when held to the light, dark blobs shimmering in amber. But I’d be careless to assume that this means they all belong in the same category — so careless! The goofy, noodly shape from Wang Yi is similar to plenty of pieces from <i>#21 [tubular/smooth/outward cycles]</i>. I briefly misplace the chunk from Gu Xiangyu among similar samples in <i>#3 [classic/crystalline]</i>. I lay them out in a dozen different ways. I rip into the existing bags, taping off sections of the table for potential new subgroupings, grumbling when I lose track of where a sample came from. It’s frustrating work. It’s disheartening to see old, discarded categories suddenly reappear. I torture myself knowing that next week some new debris will emerge, its whispering whorls demanding that I see the entire collection, hundreds of voxelite shards, in yet another way. Still, I keep turning the kaleidoscope. I take out my earbuds, and listen for the low and intermangled percussion of order within the chaos.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>I know I’ve seen these shapes before.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Deng’s asked me countless times what it’s all for, printing neikotic debris. I would mumble something about potential patterns I was seeing, ways of taxonomizing it. <i>Potential patterns,</i> she’d groan. The proto-science of 19<span class=\"s1\"><sup>th</sup></span>-century dilettante naturalists, desiccating and naming and classifying, willing truth to the surface with idle musings and musket shot. <i>Potential patterns</i> were the stuff of men unwilling to put down the brandy and really, really think. She’d glance towards trash bins of empty bottles and bento boxes, just kind enough to leave the last part unsaid:<i> you wanna categorize that, too? </i>I never had the courage to tell her that her own words, scrawled across a Stanford chalkboard the day we met, were sufficient to explain this hobby, this predilection, this madness of mine:<i> REPETITION IS THE SHADOW OF STRUCTURE.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>I know I’ve seen these shapes before.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">An hour passes. The table looks like an alien geology museum, covered edge to edge with half my collection. Yet I’m no closer to satisfaction. Logic defies me. For the umpteenth time, I pick up one of my new pieces, something made of conical spikes and elliptical holes, all protruding from each other. Its insides sparkle tauntingly. Vision is little more than a conduit here: I stare into the shard, allowing the gestalt of it to tickle my brain directly. The shapes behind the shapes are layered, nuanced, fractalized.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>I know I’ve seen these shapes before</i>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Or felt them, at least. But whichever piece I could choose as this new shard’s neighbor would imply a redrawing of boundaries, a sloshing of consequences. I close my eyes and its spikes dance behind them, because of course they do; the thing they teach you about debris, once you’ve developed neikotic channels, is that even in soberspace you’d be a fool to look directly at it.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If I had a death wish, I’d bring all these models into loop-lock. I’d see all the angles and sides that three dimensions can’t capture, I’d run a thousand tensor comparisons a second — and in the last moment before my mind is crushed irretrievably under the weight of all this junk, I’d have the insight that eludes me in this cold light, in this frigid basement room. But I’m not so stupid as that.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Not quite.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I find the tryptamine pen in my backpack. Twist the knob on the bottom: micrograms per pascal-second. Tryptamines are for loop-lock, sure, and if you freetrip too hard your neikotic channels will be all gooey the next day. It’s why neikonauts are always fucked on phens, and why mushrooms are a tourist drug. But my problem has never been achieving loop-lock. I find the bottom of the heavy mesh swivel chair, calm myself, and inhale.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>The DMT hits my bloodstream almost immediately, and with no tiles and no scanner it’s like constellations of triangles it’s like rivers of eyes it’s like jack-in-the-box-of-snakes-and-ladders it’s like layers of jade and snacks in the ballroom and sliding through saturated concentric and waving and fractal and alive and frames of mmmmmmmmmmmmme overlapping and unfolding primary-colored origami on the downbeat of a rhythm from just down the nautilus...and then I remember, somehow, what I brought myself here to do —</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>grasping at remove, raising mmmmmmmmmmmmmmy lead-dead contraption of a hand to inspect</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>this piece of debris and this one and this one and this one</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>spikes glisten facets heave with the suggestion of others</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>popcorn-kernels with zigzags of sight’s fullness of color’s precursor<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>and Iiiiiiiii remember it, Iiiiiiiii see it</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>sight entwingles with memory</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>those few low-poly frames sent back up from the diving-bell</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiii’ve</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>seen these shapes before</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>they all fit together somehow</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>sight and memory morning and night shadow then and shadow now</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>topologies collude exteriors align gears mesh</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Iiiiiiiiiii — know — these<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>— go — together</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I hold on to this, I hold so tight and don’t let go, as the curve peaks and the drug fades and my vision comes to rest. I hold and hold, and the holding is what persists back to sobriety, a grasping that clicks so neatly into the clockwork, until I’m sober and merely sweating, gasping for air that I already had. Five black-and-gold pieces lie before me. Just a moment ago I was convinced that they fit together, apparently at angles so acute that they’ve slunk back into the fabric of spacetime. I’m left holding a sixth shard of voxelite, suddenly baffled by what I meant to do with it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>I know I’ve seen these shapes before.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But of course I have. I’ve been seeing them all day; I saw them in Mbetethi’s mind. I drop the sixth piece, grimacing at the dents it leaves in my hand, at the murky golden spikiness that persists when I close my eyes. <i>I know these go together. </i>I remember that in my throat; I might have shouted it. But the truth of it is flattened, the chorus of it gone silent. Isn’t that what I had already known before?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Outside, a light clicks on. Someone padding around the Neikotic Safety floor. I defrost the conference room door and find Deng peering at me from the other side.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Dinner good?” I ask, as she steps inside. In the moment, it’s all the Mandarin I can put together.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Oh...” she sighs, seeing the mess I’ve made of the conference room table, and likely smelling what I’ve been smoking on. In her slight frame, in her old-fashioned jacket, something seems to gently collapse. She surveys the room for some way to set it all straight with a word, but it eludes her. “This <i>again?”</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">All the blood that’s supposed to be in my brain is in my ears. I feel exposed, drained — and, in the fresh burst of air conditioning that she let into the conference room, very cold. History suffocates me; I feel like someone playing Mona Xu in a re-enactment of one of her legendary blowouts with Dr. Deng. I know she feels it too. Silently, I start to scoop the debris into its bags, losing some finer-grained distinctions in the shuffle. Deng says nothing, only picks up a piece and raises an eyebrow. <i>Where does this go?</i> She turns out to be a fast learner, correctly bagging the next one with a wry smile. We work in silence this way for a few minutes until the table is nearly clear.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I know there’s something here.” Eventually, I squeeze this past the lump in my throat. “Nobody else is looking at things this way, and maybe that’s for good reason. But I know there are patterns.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Deng snaps a box shut. She assesses her own words, speaking softly, slowly. “I was here, once, you know. Not exactly, but I remember the feeling of wanting it all just to fit together somehow. I wanted a periodic table. It’s dangerous, nebulous work you’re wading into. But maybe every generation has to taste for themselves.” In the moment I’m struck by the stillness I see in her eyes; no insistence, no reaction. “What makes it debris is that we have a hard time letting it go. <i>Of course</i> there are patterns, Mona. The hard part is admitting that they don’t matter.”</p>\n</section>",

            "content_html": "<section>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I shouldn’t be thinking about the Mirror Sea at all. They gave me pills to take if I start.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But it’s not easy, not thinking about the Sea, when its inhabitants are the city’s unofficial mascots. This spring we passed a milestone: ten years after Shanghai Party Secretary Xia Zitian’s signature surveillance project was outed as a fraud, after the original system was hastily dismantled, there are more Mirror Sea cameras than ever before. An official tally would be impossible, would involve unprecedented cooperation between Blue Delta and the Ward Council and tribes of squatters in abandoned power plants. But that’s what they think.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Why? <i>Why?</i> It was the first question I posed to Deng when we stepped off the plane at Hongqiao International. She gave a quiet little sigh when she saw the fiberglass Ripple models hanging from the terminal ceiling, projected into three dimensions and frozen in a wispy moment of wall-clock time. The city had torn itself to pieces when it learned that this is all there was to the Mirror Sea: no large language model making sense of the latent space behind the billion eyes. No enlightened, forward-looking governance model to replicate all across China. Only a small cadre of officials watching the blobs in the world’s most expensive lava lamp, pawning their own opinions off as a supercomputer’s. So why on earth had the city resurrected it, block by block, ward by ward? What was there to celebrate?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“I don’t know,” Deng had said curtly. Her eyes were fixed on the baggage carousel — mine were already drifting to the screens proudly pointing out known thoroughfares in the Sea. Dozens of Ripples streamed by, though back then I could barely see them, much less pick them apart. “I’ve been gone for too long. You’ll have to figure that out for yourself.” I bet, even now, that she regrets saying that.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But I shouldn’t be thinking about the Mirror Sea at all, so I don’t.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">This first night, I take the train right home to Xietu South. I live here because it’s one of few wards in the city where there are no cameras and no displays. At night, Xietu is the hum of ancient air conditioners, parents chasing children chasing bubblecopters, a starmap of flaring cigarettes. It’s a flimsy plastic bag of dumplings, my own footsteps on five flights of dusty stairs, the echo of the click of the light. I fish out Kasibar and Kuang, which Deng wants me to review, and fall asleep with it tented on my face. Nothing happens this first night except that it starts to rain.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The rain is a reminder of how much sky there is, how many layers of clouds can pile up above the mouth of the Yangtze this time of year. The lobby of Building 1 is a muddy mess, and the Mirror Sea display in the corridor beyond glows with a dull, persistent grey. <i>Do the Ripples know what rain is?</i> I allow myself the question, but not an answer.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">Today, I will focus on neikotic fundamentals. I will let someone else handle the clinic. At noon, I attend that seminar I signed up for and take scratchy, feverish, multicolored notes. At two, I visit the voxelite fab again, search the catalogue for <i>spectral sieve</i>, and walk out with an armful of seminal eggs in the field of dimensionality reduction. I ponder one for a while, managing to peel back the entire first layer, the shadow of an algorithm taking shape in my mind. Something else competes for space — the dim golden spikiness of last night’s misadventure with the debris. I wonder if I should go down and get an inversion. But that, Mona dear, is just an excuse to visit the clinic.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When Deng arrives for our check-in, I am conspicuously reading K&amp;K on a couch in the department lounge, gritting my teeth against Kuang’s Identity. Deng seems more than ready to pretend last night didn’t happen; she greets me with a brisk smile and a terrifyingly businesslike crack of her knuckles.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“So what have you found out?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Keep in mind that this is how she starts probably half of our meetings. Over time I’ve learned to come with an answer to this question, even if it’s just a tidbit from a distant subfield of neikotics.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You said that the mystery algorithm leaving behind all this debris must be a spectral sieve. I think I understand why you think that. So there’s this bit in K&amp;K...” It hurts a little to admit how illuminating my half-hour with a foundational textbook was. “A spectral sieve is going to take a complicated structure and spit out a simpler model of it. That model excludes parts of the original that don’t belong to what they call a full, uh...”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“A fully convex recurrence,” Deng offers, not unkindly.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“And those are expressed as spikes at relatively prime frequencies in the spectrum of the model. And that’s exactly what we see <i>here</i>, and <i>here</i>, and <i>here</i> in the debris that we’ve been collecting. In the spectra of the debris,” I hurry to add, flipping through a deck of spectrograms. In my ziplock cataloging system, I’ve numbered it in Sharpie: this new debris is Material #110. But I keep that to myself.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“All that in one day?” Caught off-guard, she looks impressed for exactly one second. Then: “So what’s next?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This comment brings us right up to the edge of one of the great pits of disagreement pockmarking our relationship. But — you know — fresh start?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Well,” I begin, drawing a diver’s breath. “I was hoping that this would help us, you know...reverse-engineer my inversion a little. And, you know, I think we could probably put a little paper out on this? Whatever the egg is that’s messing up all these Big Three traders, it’s already an open secret. It could hit the Soup soon, and we could be ready...”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Deng’s brow furrows in a particular way which is shorthand for hours and hours of exasperated pleading. I inflect my voice with a particular sympathetic insistence, looking for an opening: “I know your policy on publishing about the Bridge. And I get it — the inversions it produces are one-offs. They’re not replicable, they’re not quantifiable...and so writing about them...doesn’t...help...anyone.” I try not to audibly grit my teeth. “But this is different! It’s worked on more than a dozen patients with the same neikosis. Two dozen! If I’m going to have a research agenda —”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You’re right,” Deng agrees simply. “It’ll make for a fine paper.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For the second, third, fourth time this week I have to wonder, <i>what did they do with the old Deng?</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“But I’m not going to get involved,” she adds. <i>Ah. There she is.</i> “I’ve been trying to convince the world that neikotic safety means more than just computing inversions and extracting debris. That it can be proactive, and not just reactive. Forgive an old woman a little puffery, but I’m trying to be the standard-bearer for another way. So if I...now...<i>especially</i> with the...” She sighs. “It’ll be a damn good paper, Mona, and that’s exactly why I can’t put my name on it.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Rain beats hard on Deng’s basement half-window as I consider this, and find, to my astonishment...</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“That...you know, that actually makes a lot of sense.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Deng beams at me. She leans over her desk a little. “This is growth, Mona. This is you finding your way as a neikologist. And there’s more than one person in this department who would love to help you with the analysis and slap their name on as corresponding author. I can set up a meeting with Dr. Qin, perhaps. Or Dr. Guo, he’s not in safety but he knows a thing or two about spectral sieves...”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I was thinking Dr. Rui.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I haven’t given it any thought, actually, but suddenly it seems right.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Dr. Rui Zhang?” Deng sounds taken aback. “Why him? Any particular reason?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It could have applications to soberware,” I suggest with a smile. Deng snorts, but I can tell she doesn’t find the old joke particularly funny. “He was in the clinic the other day. He already had a few guesses about what my inversion is, mathematically speaking. And, y’know what? He was <i>nice</i> about it. He —”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Best to leave the rest unsaid.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Then you should reach out to Dr. Rui,” Deng says evenly. “And soon, perhaps, because he can get very busy.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I doubt this very much; the soberware group is not known to publish at a breakneck pace. Our conversation moves on, into discussions of a study plan and departmental goings-on. But Deng is suddenly very interested in polishing her glasses on her YINS fleece, and I can’t stop wondering whether I misspoke. I recall Deng steering away from Rui at department mixers. Their bizarrely stilted interaction with an old Fudan colleague at a poster session. I remember the airy, offhand way she once called him a <i>bridge troll</i>. I hope she doesn’t think I mentioned him to spite her.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There were plenty who assumed from the start that the Mirror Sea was a fraud: that there was no anonymization, that it was seeing faces and tracking individuals, that nothing had really changed. When the Xia Zitian Papers dropped, everyone assumed they’d prove as much. But the story they told was much stranger. The cameras really did what Xia claimed: they blurred and abstracted, sliced and diced. It really was a glimpse, as the Secretary himself loved to say, at the fabric of society itself. The bombshell was that the fabric was inhabited.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Were the things wriggling around in the Mirror Sea <i>alive</i>? This was the question that Xia’s policy team had fixated on. <i>Yes</i> had an unhinged, rising gleam to it; <i>no</i> reached for causality and free will and always ended on a minor seventh, a sucking of teeth. The debates were a meter deep on A4 paper. They had become unhealthily obsessed with the behavior and well-being of the Ripples, and no one more than the big man himself. It was the final piece his opponents needed to rip Shanghai away from him, away from China, creating the Yangtze Delta Orthogonal Zone. Blue Delta promised to tear the system down. Even as they did, they couldn’t tear their eyes off the feeds.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">But </span>I shouldn’t be thinking about the Mirror Sea, so I pay no attention to the countless portholes that Shanghai has pried back open for itself: tiny LCD screens in storefront windows and in elevators. Spherical fishbowl quasigrams floating within the fountains of Century Park. Six-story projections on the sides of shopping centers. And then there are the cameras that feed them, winking everywhere from high, oblique shadows. The ones you see are from the Xia era: reflective, iridescent, teardrop-shaped things, with the iconic blind-eye symbol ringing the lens. The ones you don’t are modern, impossibly small, the anonymizing algorithm carved into nanoscale channels on the lens itself. Sometimes regular CCTV cameras are employed, the Lam-Waldmann Hash running entirely in software; this is considered vaguely obscene.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">I’m not thinking about any of this, by the way.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Not even sterile Beiwan Ward is immune — the sidewalk from campus to the metro is paced out by slender, tasteful pillars, their edgeless displays frothing with suggestion. Beiwan is brand-new, a gleaming shell around YINS: dorms, a few pricey takeout joints, a lone tiyan-guan. It doesn’t need to attract nightlife by attracting Ripplechasers, or to lease its feed to the highest bidder. Instead, its barren little Mirror Sea is public art, an insistence of placehood. Beneath the cameras, mesh baskets overflow with all the usual votives — prayer blocks and dried flowers and fluorescent voxelite beads — but these are refreshed on schedule by the maintenance men who shine the windows and renormalize the hedges. Any chalk on the walls would be power-washed by dawn.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">But, as always, I’m not thinking about it. I’m going the long way to avoid it, in fact, splashing along beside the six-lane speedway that hems Beiwan against the east bank of the Huangpu. The way across is access-controlled footbridges; on the other side, light industry melts into a howling wilderness of warehouse fires, inhabited only by the desperate and insane. They say the Mirror Sea is thickest out there now, mostly aftermarket cameras installed (by who and for what?) after Xia’s fall. They say they show it live on solar mesh screens, jump-scares hidden around bends. They say if you see something floating by, you’d better run.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The second night, when I get home, the street is a sewer. So why am I struck by the urge to walk? I find myself pulling on rubber boots in the dead of night, tiptoeing downstairs against the ears of nosy neighbors, and finding footing on the slick cobblestones of Xietu South. I walk in long, rectangular loops around the ward. I trade brief glances with delivery drivers, redlights on patrol — who else would be out in this weather, at this time of night, and <i>why</i>? I know the answer, of course. But this night, I keep it bundled beneath my black voxelwear parka. At the boundary of the ward, I turn home, and stare at the ceiling until I fall asleep.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">But I can dream about it, right?</p>\n</section>",

            "content_html": "<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Yangtze Delta Orthogonal Zone was to China what California had become to the United States. Great powers inside great powers, doves growing fat in the bellies of hawks, surprise twins. Neither wanted war. More to the point: neither wanted to be militarized, to be made a target for the other. Both the blue delta and the golden coast had wriggled and convulsed right up to the brink of sovereignty. Both now dangled from their motherlands by tense threads, the parallels uncanny, the details a mess. In San Francisco, in bombed-out China Daily newsboxes, I saw Xia Zitian’s name in three-inch print. I understood that in Shanghai the fiasco with the cameras had tipped the balance somehow.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Back home we tried calling our double defection the Shanghai-California Mutually Assured Security Arrangement. On TV they gleefully pronounced it <i>shikamasa</i>, like a foreign word, or a shaken maraca. The English translation of the Mandarin name is worse, though. It was a big day at the networks when they got ahold of <i>CASH Axis</i>. But I was grateful. It was Deng who invited me to Shanghai, but it was SHCA-MASA that arranged my position at YINS, my passage across the Pacific, and a very favorable ward alignment. I would have the run of the city. I could go anywhere.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But mostly I just stayed at home.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I didn’t understand this fractured city of twenty million. My Mandarin was far more brittle than I thought, my Shanghainese nonexistent. And I had bet my whole life on the whims of one singularly strange woman. I was at YINS a year before the undergraduates, and an excess of student housing sat idle in Beiwan Ward. I was given a two-bedroom apartment to myself, and told to expect a flatmate soon. But that whole year, no one arrived to join me. Sometimes I’d wander into that empty second room for its view of the skyline. I’d curl up on that cold concrete floor, one earbud tuned into an emergency radio app.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I'd hear strange things, on the far side of midnight, that in the static I could only half-understand.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I was badly lonely and eager for company, and in my second September it arrived with no warning. It took the form of a shipping container’s worth of bags, and a new graduate student named Cai Yuhui.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I’m here for the other room,” she explained cooly.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She spoke in curlicue Shanghai slang no dictionary understood. She wrote in shanzi, that semantic ultrasound of obscure Chinese characters floating disused above the spoken language. I’d have to hit my tryptamine pen, sometimes, to make sense of her messages. She’d eat her takeout, crouched with her feet on the chair, engaged in dozens of chats. She’d take two bites and throw the rest away. She was skin and tits and bones and she wandered around with it all on full display, like she lived alone.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Her father was a Blue Delta midwig, a Ward Council delegate for some heap of glass in Pudong. I never saw her doing coursework, and so I thought she was the kind of rich and stupid that grew YINS new wings. The truth was much worse. Cai Yuhui was rich and <i>smart</i>. She had finished her coursework years ago; she was publishing papers, elaborating on the mathematics of the Lam-Waldmann Hash. All during the day, too, because her nights were her own. Somehow it took me three months to figure out what she did with them.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You’re a Ripplechaser?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She lifted a headphone and tinny music spilled out. I gestured to the pile of windows crowding her side of the laggy kitchen counter.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“A Ripplechaser! You, ah —”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But she cut me off with a finger to her glossy lips. Shhh. As in, duh.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It wasn’t like she tried to hide it. Along with her group chats and keyword spiders and Doujiang amalgams, she’d always have five or six windows open right into the Mirror Sea. Some of these feeds were public. Some she paid for. I later learned that some were hers alone, a thousand cams sliced off some unsuspecting ward’s subnet as a gift from her <i>fans</i>. A unique vantage point in the high-dimensional silt of that other world, a competitive edge, for her eyes only. I never saw much float by. Just the odd tendril, or the corner of a choir-bubble clipping through her projections. But her eyes were always darting back to those screens, seeking something. And when she’d find it —</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“<i>Wo xian zou la</i>,” she’d shout into the apartment at nine, nine thirty at night, as though we had been deep in conversation. The door would rattle and I wouldn’t see her again, sometimes for days. Then there was a whole week where I thought she was gone for good. I thought about calling...who? Campus security? The Beiwan redlights? It seemed stupidest of all to call the bluelights, knowing it would probably get back to her father somehow. Fuck it. She was probably on holiday.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She resurfaced one night while I was alone in the Neikotic Safety clinic, scrubbing vomit off a scanner. Maybe she was surprised to see me there, maybe not, I dunno. But even in the half-light I could see it behind her eyes. She had been using Tenfold Gate.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“T-t-ten...”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She couldn’t get the words out, but Tenfold Gate was the only game in town. It was the clinic’s nightmare, ripping through YINS like a fever for weeks before the Safety faculty could even begin to compute an inversion. The debris that it left behind was atrocious. It worked farther into the lower functions of the brain than anything else. Vestibular chaos. Arrhythmia. Phantom limbs. But it did graph traversals faster than anything else, too. It was an indispensable subroutine in everyone’s research. They’d come to the clinic unable to swallow, speaking in tongues, but elated by the heights that it let them reach in loop-lock. They’d take the inversion, which didn’t really work, and be back within days. We started to realize, even if they didn’t, that Tenfold Gate was addictive.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I led Cai to the least-filthy scanner bed. I had to strap her in. She had been scratching welts into her skin.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I have to warn you, this isn’t very effective yet.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I felt bad admitting it. Deng and Rui and Qin were sleeping in shifts in the faculty lounge, sharpening their Dirac deltas, trying to find an inversion that would stick. And here I was, Deng’s supposed protégé, still good for cleaning up bodily fluids and not much else. I fired the current version over and over into Cai’s tilespace, <i>zwoop</i> and <i>zwoop</i> and <i>zwoop </i>and so forth. It bounced right off the debris.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Zwoop.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">No one told me about the Deng Bridge during my training as a clinician. But stories swirled around my advisor: I knew that it was supposed to exist, and what she had supposedly built it for. I hadn’t been looking for it; I had been looking for mop heads. But I found it in the back closet, a dark metal box the size of a minifridge with two gigantic, antique EASL 1.0 ports. It was impossible to mistake.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Zwoop.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Cai came down in bad shape. Her debris was resistant to inversion, and all we had done was provoke it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I can run it a few more times, but I’m already damaging your neikotic channels.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She pulled the visor hood off her eyes. She was a mess. Never a glint of vulnerability from her, and now <i>this</i>. I could tell she hated me seeing her this way. I was shocked to find I might hate it even more. I was shocked to hear what that tug in my gut was offering on my behalf: “There’s something else, maybe, that we can try.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In the dead of night, months previous, I had tested the Bridge in loopback mode, probing around my own tilespace, learning how to manipulate myself at remove. And at the peak of the Tenfold Gate crisis, I overheard a brief, furious exchange between Rui (<i>I wouldn’t ask if we weren’t desperate</i>) and Deng (<i>If you so much as show me that box, I will walk right out of this institute</i>). This wasn’t the way to prove myself to my advisor, but then, what was?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Reckless, <i>reckless</i>, Mona! But I swear even then I knew it would work.</p>\n</section>",

            "content_html": "<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">Another rainy morning finds me knocking on Dr. Rui’s office door.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“If it’s broken again, I’m not signing for it.” His reedy voice comes, muffled, through the door. There’s a two-beat pause and the clatter of glassware. Then: “Oh! Xu! Yes. I am sorry, really, do please come in.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Rui’s office is just down the hall from Deng’s, but I’ve never had so much as a peek inside. The shelves ringing the room are loaded down with glassware, in shocking amounts, so many flasks and beakers and tubes that it’s not even funny, so many more that it’s funny again. Some I can half-name from chem lab. Many more are of singular shape and inscrutable purpose, the whiff of neikotics about them.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Just drop that in there.” Dr. Rui gestures to a large transparent vase of umbrellas. “Come, come.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Neikotics is a young person’s game, and in his stilted way Rui tends to play it so. He shoots around on the quad with guys half his age. He intersperses his lecture slides with k-hop gifs. But now I see him in his element — dark wood, warm lighting, puttering around in suspenders — and his element makes him look comfortable in old age. He was Deng’s supervisor at Fudan, maybe? Which would make him, what, sixty, sixty-five?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They’re only finding out now what half a lifetime of loop-lock will do to a person.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Can I get you anything? Let me guess, Deng has you hooked on her chamomile?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I’d take an espresso.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“<i>Two espressos,</i>” he shouts to a little machine on his back shelf. And he looks expectantly at me, but my eyes keep wandering to the shelves. In hundreds of reflections, his twin floor lamps gleam back like a pair of tiny golden eyes. Rui doesn’t seem to mind that I’m distracted by it all; to the contrary, so is he. “Some good, smooth shapes in those,” he notes enthusiastically. “That’s most of the trick of soberware, you know. Just a nicely-shaped container.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I nod politely, wondering just what it is that Rui Zhang does here all day. Progress on soberware has been, to put it politely, slow. State of the art is still that one viral video from a few years back, of a postdoc factoring huge numbers in his head as he sips on a tryptamine pen. <i>That’s</i> what really throws people off. It’s right there in the name: it’s supposed to stick around after loop-lock and work while you’re dead sober. But they’re not there yet, not even close.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The machine behind us quits whirring.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Sasha Shulgin’s.” He nods at a particular dusty burette as he hands me a steaming doodad of espresso. “Here, sit. You may not know this, Mona, and I doubt you’ll like it, but you’ve been the talk of the faculty lounge all week. Everybody and their mother wants to know when we can expect a paper on this incredible new inversion of yours.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I sip. “That’s...actually kind of why I’m here.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Rui doesn’t say anything, but his face contracts in soft surprise. <i>Oh?</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And I relay to him what Deng told me. “Dr. Deng isn’t going to put her name on this.” In fact, I wonder whether Rui might have heard our discussion yesterday afternoon, echoing through the basement ductwork.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Well, I don’t see why not. She, quite literally, wrote the book on neikotic inversion.” Sudden understanding hits him, and more than anything he looks a little sad. “Ah. Right. You did it with the Bridge.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“This isn’t the first time she and I have had this discussion. I’ve been using it for more than a year now, and I always thought it’d be good to do a little write-up. But she wants nothing to do with it. She says it’s not <i>replicable</i> since we have the only prototype, and it’s too dangerous to use. And now...”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Push comes to shove.” Rui nods thoughtfully. “And you, rightfully, want the paper out.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Yeah. I was hoping you could help.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“And why me?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Well...” I have to try not to phrase this as a joke at Rui’s expense. “There’s something interesting about this class of neikotic debris.” I have to remember not to say <i>Material #110.</i> “It’s got a degree of structure that you rarely see. Even in the sober mind it’s not just sitting there. It’s doing something. Trying, at least.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You’re saying that this has applications to soberware.” He chuckles. “No, don’t apologize. It’s fine! It’s validating, in fact. Of course you know that the study of soberware was born from the discovery of neikotic debris. If such constructs can linger in the sober mind, surely we can put them to good use! It excited us all greatly, in the start.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Rui offers me a knowing look, like it’s me and him who really <i>get</i> it. “In the start,” I offer back uncertainly.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“But that was decades ago, and progress is slow, and...well, it remains to be seen who will be right in the end. They haven’t shuffled me offstage yet. But in truth, neikotic debris has become our template for what not to do. It’s unpredictable, uncontrollable, and unsafe.” He pauses to flick some lint from his jacket.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Let me ask you something else,” he continues, slowly. “Do you know why Dr. Deng is so reticent about the Bridge?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“No. She hates talking about it.” I blink. “Do you?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I have a sense. And I’ll tell you what I can. She and I were both at Fudan, on that original loop-lock grant, with a single UTMS rig the size of a tank. Deng was fresh out of the Navy, nosing around for military applications, and don’t doubt me when I say she worked out about half of the fundamentals with her right hand, and the other half with her left. People say she came back to rest on her laurels at YINS, and that’d be a real shame. But they also say she’s earned it. Do you know who coined the term <i>neikongren</i>?”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He smiles, raises his eyebrows, and accelerates past the question.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It was secretive, back then, so secretive. Students were earning doctorates on the project who didn’t even know that psychedelic drugs were involved, and don’t give me that look! You couldn’t exactly get tryptamine pods at Easy Joy in those days. Circles within circles. Deng had the money, and the connections, and the mandate — and she sat in a circle of her own, at the dead center, building her Bridge. It wasn’t clear that anyone <i>could</i> help, not that she was offering. We got promises of a demonstration, then half-hearted memos, then glimpses through frosted glass. She turned farther and farther inward. She stopped coming to department meetings. We lost track of her entirely in the chaos with Xia and Blue Delta. Months later we learned she’d slipped overseas.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I can’t even remember the full sequence of Deng’s subsequent stints: Tokyo, Oxford, Goettingen, mumble mumble mumble, and eventually Stanford. But there’s something completely unsatisfiyng about Rui’s explanation: basically, I knew all this already.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“So what do you think happened with the Bridge?” I ask, a little frustrated, a little amused, trying to read the answer off his expression. “What, she hurt herself somehow? Is this why she won’t go into loop-lock anymore?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Well, nobody doubted that Deng would test the machine on herself. But the thing about the Deng Bridge, the irony of the whole ordeal, is that you can’t truly test it alone.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dr. Rui has apparently been waiting for his espresso to cool to this precise temperature; he downs it now in an extended slurp. “We may use them every day, but DMT and its variants are dangerous drugs, in endless and subtle ways.” Drugs: <i>du-pin</i>, poison-product, instead of <i>mihuan-yao</i>, fantasy-medicine. “I think you understand that better than most. Some people came out of those early days unscathed, and plenty more didn’t. Most of those names aren’t in textbooks.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“That’s the whole story?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“No.” Rui meets my eyes with a little smile. “God, no. There are names and details that I know for certain Deng would not have me divulge. But it’s enough for you to understand.” There’s a knock at the door, and Rui stands to see me out. “You know, she speaks highly of you among faculty. Calls you persistent. Maybe it was <i>obstinate</i>, which would be her highest compliment, but anyway, she thinks you can write this paper yourself. Do what you can, pull in some models, bash something out. And then find me if you need a second pair of eyes. How’s that?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Sure thing. Thanks, Dr. Rui.”</p>\n</section>",

            "content_html": "<section>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I entered Cai’s tilespace, and inverted her Tenfold Gate debris on the first try. Sitting upright in parallel scanner beds, the memory of what happened in there was already gone. But that was just sandcastles. The expression of clarity and relief on her face, that’s where I could have lived forever. The tryptamine remnants were beep-buzzing tunelessly, muttering crazy things in my ear. </span><span class=\"s2\"><i>I never knew my own cells</i>: every one a treasure filled with treasures filled with treasures, a translucent iridescent music box, transcription whirring away in frenzied melodies, the taut and sensual ritual of mitosis. <i>I never knew my own mind</i>: all those layers never peeled back, all those unknown corners never turned. But Cai Yuhui did. For ten seconds the image of me that existed inside her was realer than I was. The locus of myself was in her eyes.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“You should be careful,” I whispered. Deng might have been just down the hall. “I don’t know if I’ll be able to do that again.” But I would, of course. Ten times in the next six weeks. I didn’t know if Cai had a real use for Tenfold Gate, or if she was just addicted to the subtle pleasures of graph homeomorphisms. But I didn’t ask. I was addicted to her relief. Besides, some vantablack subself of mine was learning to pilot the diving-bell. I (she?) was doing it better and faster. Perhaps I (it?) was the only person alive both willing and able to operate the Deng Bridge.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">I said nothing about this to Deng.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Cai and I: things changed between us, but maybe not how you’d think. Back at the flat we still didn’t talk much. We had no friends in common, which is to say that she had a million and I had none. But maybe she sensed that I was no longer so resentful, but genuinely, gently curious, about her Ripplechasing life. And gently, she began to let me in. Departing one night she pressed a slip of paper into my hands. In shanzi, in triple-knotted phono-semantic rebus, she had written something like: <i>the entire city is a great coral reef.</i> There was also a doodle on the page, a spiderwhorl of never-intersecting lines which clung to my mind even and especially when I looked away. I knew enough about Ripplechasing, at least, to know that this was called a sigil.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><i>The entire city is a great coral reef.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">It was not exactly actionable information. But nor was Cai the only one saying it. I heard it, muffled, in the voices of newscasters and flower-sellers, trying to break free. And I saw it, that sigil of it. I saw that everywhere: in Sharpie on ward-gates. In ink on skin. Most of all: in chalk on everything else. It welled up like a dull wet pressure on my forebrain. Days and days later, tiling out of a long loop-lock session, I felt the mental logjam break. I took a long walk around campus, soaking in the blue hour. Wondering: how did I fail to understand her meaning then?</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">On Beiwan Ward’s main street, I stopped in front of one of the displays. I could always just barely make out the Ripples; that night, I finally saw them clearly. Their motion was sensible and predictable. Their boundaries were crisp. They were the color and texture of coral that night, and unusually visible against their surroundings. I watched for a long time; others lingered in the twilight, watching with me. Home was barely two blocks away but the walk took an age, unpeeling myself over and over from the screens. Upstairs I grabbed Cai and repeated her meaning back to her. Not these words, never directly, but their silhouette:</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><i>The entire city is a great coral reef.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">She grinned, and fetched me an oversized parka, violently fluorescent, with the texture of brain coral, only chopped-up and fragmented. I ran my fingers over the deep, stuttering grooves. “I printed this for you,” she said, with a touch of apology. “because I didn’t know your size.”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">We set out on foot. Cai was wearing a kind of trypophilic purple jumpsuit made of wavy coral sprouts and smokestacks. She pointed to her eyes as her Contecs blinked red. “Everyone say hi to my flatmate Mona,” she bubbled into the mic. “She’s going to help us tag some Ripples tonight.” I waved, sheepishly, to fifteen thousand viewers.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Cai knew all the best lines through Shanghai: she knew which cameras lead to which displays on what kind of time delay. She knew which rooftops were shortcuts across which ward boundaries. She and I and her Ripplechaser friends could traipse slowly across a block in East Xuhui and then sprint through narrow alleyways to catch Ripples bearing fragments of our texture and color on displays in Tianzifang. The delays got shorter and shorter. The Ripples got more vibrant, and the crowds of chasers got thicker. But Cai liked the slow build. She herded cats, leading our orange-purple-yellow stochastic parade from behind. By the time we got our first realtime glimpse of ourselves, of the Ripple we’d become, we were properly warmed up. We felt like we’d earned it.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The Scrambler is an all-ways all-walk crosswalk in Xintiandi, the walls and rooftops packed to the gills with Mirror Sea displays and quasigrams that are famously, despite the Weather Bureau’s grumbling, not on any kind of delay. We arrived panting and sweating from all directions at once. There was no saying how many of us there were, how many paths we arrived by. I had stuck by Cai’s side — but that’s not really how it felt. I felt very loose, very expansive. I was starting to get clear glimpses of myself through strangers’ eyes. Starting to feel like I was on both sides of the camera at once.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“Say it,” one of us whispered into the other’s ear, a hand on a shoulder, another pointing up towards a dripping neon quasigram.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Mouth movements in response, distant, abstract.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">And then Mona Xu was gone. At least for the night.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><i>The entire city is a great coral reef.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The daytime was still clinical drudgework and long, fruitless meeting with Dr. Deng. But — the order that our minds make of blurs of light and sound in the streets? That simple statement unlocked <i>more</i> of it. The movement of the octopus explained the cut of the skyline. The contours of low-slung coral explained the gait of grannies, the timing of trains. I fell deeper into fascinated satisfaction, and the more I invited the thought into my daydreams, the more I was rewarded by what I saw. The things my professors said made more sense, sparked when rubbed together, when seen through this lens. Of course they had no idea, but other people did — I could tell they were tuning their words to resonate with this idea, and I began to seek them out, to reward their attention with my own.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><i>The entire city is a great coral reef.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">For a while I had to scour the Internet to find it, but soon there was nothing else in my feeds. I gorged myself on the aesthetics of it, making oblique references to it in my Advanced Techniques in Loop-Lock seminar. I knew distantly that I had become involved in something strange. That buying a scaly backpack and stickering my tablet with angelfish marked me with something not taboo, but deeply curious and reflectively impregnable to outsiders. But I didn't care about them. After two lonely years in the city, I felt like I had a hundred thousand friends whispering just out of sight. I could step onto the street, flash my jellyfish earrings or my new tattoo — <i>where had that come from?</i> — and run with a pack of strangers like I had known them all my life.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">It became too bright to look at directly. Thousands of Doujiang posts and Veeku tracks churned around its gravity well, drawing us into closer, headier orbit. There was art about it, music about it, crime about it. The aesthetic had become an ethos, even a movement, but if it stood for anything at all, it was impossible to put into words. If asked, we would deny it outright — of course the entire city is not really a coral reef. It wasn't true, it was something more than that. It was a key that unlocked a thousand doors, an abstraction so powerful that it subsumed all other thought and rewarded us with shoals of correlations, hidden variables gleaming in the sand.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">And that was just the daytime.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“How do you think they reproduce?” I asked around dawn one morning. For hours Cai and I had been walking outside to reup, letting the streetscape dissolve into waves of viscous glass. Now we were sitting in our flat.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“Mona!” she said, scandalized, but her eyes were laughing.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“How do you think the <i>Ripples</i> reproduce?” I asked. It was so freeing to hear the word leave my mouth, so right, and Cai’s breath caught when she heard it. Our eyes locked: the apartment melted away and we were back on the street, but with the clarity of conviction we saw the bulge of the world behind the world, our rectilinear reality ripe to burst. We saw the Ripples even where there were no displays.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“I think they…they go like this.”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Then we were back in the flat again, our fingers interlocked across the duvet.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“I think…” I began, already losing my train of thought. Making a face, because I was seeing my own expression through Cai’s eyes, and hers through mine. I looked so — <i>so right</i> when she saw me.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“You think?” Cai said, and I could feel her tongue curl in her mouth.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“I think they lay eggs.”</p>\n</section>",

My boots are still damp, still squeaking, on my way down the stairs. This time I’m not so coy with myself about why I’ve ventured outside. I toe the western boundary of another ward, preparing to tap my card. <i>What you’re looking for isn’t in Xietu South,</i> I admit to myself. <i>That’s why you moved here, remember?</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And this is how I find myself in the private gardens of an apartment complex two wards over, crouched in the shrubbery, staring into their fishbowl. <i>It’s hurting you to avoid it,</i> which is the rationale of the insane and the addicted. <i>You just need a little peek.</i> The fishbowl is mostly dormant, but narrow strands of a Ripple flick in unmistakable standing waves along its edges. I lean forward, keeping to the shadows, for a slightly better look. <i>Get in closer. It’s on a delay, anyhow.</i> But I know that plenty of “delayed” Mirror Sea feeds run realtime, because the entire carnival of commerce surrounding Ripplechasing depends on it. I remember Cai telling me that —</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You there! Freeze!”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And my body gives me no other choice. My knees are locked like this, my hands in the air.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>A redlight enters the courtyard, wearing a rose-quartz badge and bulletproof silk, lofting a Maglite. But his beam catches a man way to my left, scrawling deftly on the compound wall. His lines flow like topography, like a heatmap, bulging and wiggling but never intersecting. He draws counterclockwise from the center out, and his little jerky pauses tell me the pattern is not random, not memorized, but somehow...transcribed. He keeps going, red-handed, flicking glances towards the fishbowl, and the lampposts, and the LEDs blinking in high shadows. Getting a few more strokes in...</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Come with your hands up! I’ll shoot!”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The redlight twists open his vialgun. But it’s an empty threat, and I see what he doesn’t. Another black-clad figure is crouched on a high ledge, adjusting a camera. The first Chalker looks left and ducks right. He gains altitude off a bench and, clutching the arms of his companion, is carried to safety over the compound wall. The redlight swings his flashlight around halfheartedly; I hold very, very still. Then he grumbles away. And moments later, by pure coincidence, the last tendrils of the Ripple in the spherical quasigraphic display flick out of sight.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I crouch, shivering, for five minutes before I dare to move. I try all the old tricks for <i>getting into it: </i>I stare blankly into the fishbowl and its lazy hints of Ripples, focusing just past it. I loosen the boundaries of self, trying to make my vision go wide. I look for my head, hoping not to find it. Finally I admit that it might be a lost cause. Ripplechasing is just no fun when you’re alone.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I emerge from the bushes to inspect the sigil, wondering what I can glean from it, if it could lead me where I want to go. But the chalk has already melted in the downpour.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">The atmosphere is different when I walk in to my next clinic shift. More neikonauts than ever, but now there are more clinicians, too — everyone is milling around, poking at screens, trying to be helpful. The fourth and fifth scanner bays, which have been dormant for as long as I can remember, can be heard whirring in rooms farther down the hall. It seems I’m not the only one here who wants to write that important paper on this new class of debris. But people are strangely deferential to me, and it takes me all night to acclimate to my presence casting shadows, my opinion being the last word.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It’s several hours into this, and I’m running through the intake form with a patient. We’ve started reading the questions aloud, and filling out the form ourselves. This way we hope to coax more information from them, when they can’t just silently check <i>I don’t know/decline to say.</i> The new strategy, which began as an offhand idea of mine, has been effective mostly in slowing the line down. It’s around quarter to eight in the evening and almost every seat in the waiting room is taken.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“And the source of the debris?” I ask briskly. The patient, who is from a prop trading firm we’ve never heard of, looks me dead in the forehead. “Black-Scholes? Some kind of differential shellmap? A spectral sieve?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">His eyes go a little wide. Among the clinicians working behind me, a low chorus of eye-rolls and mutters offers the only answer we’ve been given tonight, from employees of no less than seven firms: <i>It’s proprietary.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It’s p–p—pp,” he begins, and then collapses to the ground.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">His eyes roll to whites. His face is already faintly blue. A glance passes among the clinicians, our medical pretense stripped away, as we all try to remember CPR. As I reach for him, he seizes with sudden, terrified, strobing alertness. With flailing grasps he reaches for something in front of him, rising half to his feet before stumbling, striking his head on the linoleum, and falling still. All I can really do is clip him with monitors and count his shallow breaths while Yao Tongduan dashes down the hall for a stretcher. The remaining neikonauts look almost as ghostly, because <i>they</i> were the mild cases, the ones chatting and ribbing and even making trades in the back of the triage line.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">By the time we get him up in the service elevator, some of his coworkers in tow, we can already see a medivac veetle’s green flashers hanging above the skyline. The EMTs who land ask his home ward and, based on this information, two of them begin to triangulate a suitable hospital; the third fits him with an oxygen mask and a readonly electrode net. “Grand mal,” she explains, staccato, leaning over the stretcher. “He’s got a little rupture in the the anterior cerebral artery. <i>Can I get a fucking terahertz pen?</i>”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It’s debris from, we think, a novel spectral sieve,” I begin breathlessly. But she glares at me, in my scrubs and badge, across the neikotic abstraction. To me, the patient’s brain is made of Lam columns and Kasibar recurrences; she knows that it’s made of cells and filling with blood. But his eyes are open, and moving, and I know this could be my only chance to answer the question that’s been driving us crazy all night.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“<i>Listen</i>,” I whisper, sidling up to the stretcher and rifling through my bag. I must have it on me, I <i>must</i>. “I need you to tell me where you picked this thing up. We’ve got a room full of patients down there. Friends of yours.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“C-c-can’t...”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Fucking...<i>there</i> it is. I hoist Mbetethi’s N-1 lanyard from my rucksack and dangle it in the poor neikonaut’s face.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Was it this man? Did he sell this to you?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">His bloodshot eyes go wide. “D-d-don’t...”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>“Where?”</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“D-d-do...”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“<i>Don’t</i> talk to him!” The EMT hisses at me. She mutters something about <i>shenjing bing de neikongren</i> as they heave him into the veetle<i>.</i> “We’ll have them call you,” she promises flatly. The craft lurches back off the ground in an explosion of steam and disppears behind curtains of heavy rain. But I have my answer. I read it off the neikonaut’s body, off the gentle, many-looped imprint left behind on his wrist.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Back in the clinic, you can hear necks crack and lungs inflate. You can feel the vortex of silent panic. The undercurrent of playful schadenfreude among the clinicians, the smirks and eye-rolls at the pretension of our city’s caste of profanely psychedelic banker-priests, has disappeared. I hear a new sympathy in Yao’s voice as he calls the next patient into the scanner room.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Where are you going?” he asks, a moment later, watching me stuff my stuff into my stuff-bag.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Out,” I mutter darkly. Part of me wants Yao to inquire further, to talk me down. Hell, to come with me. But as much as I try to glower ominously, he completely misreads my tone.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Oh! Well, I’d say you <i>deserve</i> a break!” He looks equal parts surprised and delighted. “Mona Xu. Going out.”</p>\n</section>",

            "content_html": "<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">In the scant years that such a thing has been possible, Double Descent has accreted a reputation as a neikonaut bar. It did so by pioneering the benzodiazepine soda, an oh-what-the-hell last resort for candlestick cadets who had spent all day in loop-lock with a Bloomberg terminal and desperately needed the walls to stop moving. And for those who want the walls to <i>start</i> moving, tourists one step off the Bund seeking a righteously authentic place to try their first psychedelic, there are taps of guangpan<i> </i>and qingting nestled among the IPAs. Doled out stingily unless you know how to ask.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">An hour later, this is where I start my search. At the end of a long, gently-sloping service alleyway, Double Descent is both in the middle of Pudong’s dazzling finance district and conspicuously nowhere at all. It would be almost anticlimactic to find Mbetethi here, I figure. When oddly well-lit photos of Double Descent started to appear in Must-See Shanghai listicles, some of the old crowd scattered elsewhere. But others quite literally dug in. The venue is now at least five stories deep and counting; those who know best how many floors there are, are least likely to say.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Two,” the bouncer decrees, after looking me over for a moment.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“<i>Two?”</i> All of my cool detachment disappears in an indignant puff. But I played it exactly right! From the back of the line I let a corner of my N-1 license show, betraying just a flash of its iridescence. This large man saw it and crooked his finger, summoning me past North Korean kids in spotless basketball springs, Ukranians with phosphograft prison tattoos, and garden-variety local Ripplechasers. I felt, honestly, kind of cool. Until now.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Two,” he confirms indifferently. “And I’m going to need to see your bag.” <i>This</i> I had not thought through, and I tense up as he unzips my backpack. “<i>Kai shenme wan xiao?”</i> he yelps when he sees what’s inside. “You trying to hurt someone with that?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It’s for my research. At YINS. That’s not a crime, is it?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He zips it up with a sigh, but I sort of think I’ve gained a modicum of his respect. “Any trouble and you’re gone.” He breaks off a length of glo-band and wraps it once — twice around my arm. Not enough respect to let me down to the third floor, I suppose.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Just through the doors is the Double Descent you see in the listicles: the curving mahogany bartop, the qualia-resonance wall, the triangular pool tables. <i>This is where they invented loop-lock, </i>someone at the bar explains earnestly to their date. <i>Guan Zhumi, the Suowei guy? He got the idea from the pattern of tiles in the men’s room.</i> I make my way to the second level, past another bouncer and down a narrow stairwell. Here, at least, it’s mostly neikonauts. A few of them are grooving and spiralizing on the trance floor, creating a kind of glitchy beat that makes me want to check them for debris. Many more are quietly enjoying a benzo soda — in fact, I recognize a few of them from the clinic.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Yo...<i>yo, </i>it’s, it’s her from YINS.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Mona.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“<i>Mona!</i>”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You shouldn’t be drinking that,” I cup my hands and shout back. “You should be resting at home!”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They smile languidly and point to their ears. <i>Too loud!</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I make a quick sweep of the second floor. No line for the tile wars machine, or the zilla harness, or darts. The energy among the vest types seems a little low tonight. I have to admit, Mbetethi wouldn’t be caught dead in a place like this. If he were, he’d probably flop himself across the trance floor into the dumpster.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>But what about the third floor?</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There’s no stairwell. The way down is a circular elevator in the dead center of the room.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Do I look that stupid to you?” asks the elevator bouncer when I approach, glaring down at my two-loop band. “I mean, I know your type thinks I’m dumb. But do you really think I’m a <i>one, two, many</i> kind of guy?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I try the direct approach, and show the man Mbetethi’s N-1 lanyard. “I’m sorry. I’m looking for him. Is he here? You ever see him around? I actually just need to return this license.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He just glares at me, but I saw what I was looking for in the first tenth of a second, and decide to wait him out. Over at the bar I order a five-spot microdose of guangpan<i> </i>and a lime: bright, airy, no cross-tolerance with the work stuff.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Nobody I know knows.” A neikonaut in the stool next to mine is confiding to a friend. “I’m terrified.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I hear someone over at Fudan found an inversion for the debris, at least.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I grit my teeth through this blatant YINS disrespect, and watch the bouncer go about his business. Within ten minutes a crowd arrives at the elevator and, as one of their number makes an overt show of his friendliness with the staff, I simply cram myself invisibly into the elevator.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Sneaking downstairs?” someone asks me as it lurches away. She’s wearing a garment covered in orange traffic-cone snailshells, with hair and nails to match. “Cool.” I smile back but have to turn away; the fixpoint pattern on her dress or robe or whatever is painful to look at. No doubt she’s hoping to get picked up on the cameras tonight.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The third floor is where Double Descent really starts to get picky about their clientele. I was hoping to get a good look at who they let down here, but the space is low and maze-like, the walls lit only with waves of subtly off-white LED pinpricks. I poke my head into mirror rooms, foam rooms, scent rooms, and eventually stumble into the part that’s actually a bar. Faces in booths flash behind thick copper screens. I try casually poking my head into a few of them and hit the blank, disbelieving stares of the wealthy and influential. This works about three times before I wheel around and find two men standing right behind me.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Now, my rule for Chalkers is this: if you think a person looks like a Chalker, they’re probably not. Imagine, for instance, someone in billowing black robes and white face paint steps forward to offer you a blessing, pressing an amulet into your hands. That’s not an artifact washed from the shores of another causality — it’s got an RF entropy sponge in it, and it’s going to empty your wallet. This is sound advice on the Bund, in broad daylight. Down here, I’m a little less sure.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You looking for something?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The tall one is so thin, his face stretched so tightly against his skull, that he simply looks dead.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I’m...I, uh....”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The short one, I would not generally find threatening, except for the distinct, chilling sense that his friend is the only person in the world he feels accountable to. He orbits the first man like a moon, like a bad dog on a short leash. And he barks, too, when he speaks. “We can get you so close you can taste it. <i>Lick </i>it. And we can leave you there if you want...” He only stops because the tall one puts a skeletal hand over his mouth.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You’re not supposed to be down here.” The dead man points at the obvious, at my double-looped wrist. “But you came down here. What do you want?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Suddenly it’s very clear what I’m supposed to say. “Trying to buy parts.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Buy parts.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I need a new beamformer. And some softmax arrays, and other shit.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You try Taobao?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The first wave of guangpan hits, and it’s nice and shallow and wide, like there’s plenty of room to maneuver. Plenty of room for my new friends here. I hear the echo of fear in my voice, and the echo means it’s gone, and I’m smooth and symmetrical and all right. “I heard prices are reasonable here.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The second one seems to object, seems to want to bite me, but the first one gives him a brick wall of a look. <i>If she wants parts she wants parts.</i> It’s not like bluelights, or redlights, or the fucking Weather Bureau care about <i>parts</i>. “C’mon,” he says. And he gestures at my wrist: “and lose that.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I don’t know where I expected to be taken, but it wasn’t into the bright halogen light of the kitchen, of this utterly mundane workplace embedded behind another mysterious door. The two men — I still can’t decide if they’re Chalkers or not — greet the cooks with disarming smiles. We pass through another door, down another stairwell, into a storeroom. Just well-lit enough to read serial numbers. Twenty or thirty people are here, scattered around card tables. Mostly what they’re doing is unloading secondhand or stolen scanner components.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">One of them is Mbetethi.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">There he is, in a makeshift corner booth, among spooled miles of fiber-optic cable. I spy him in the half-half-light behind black tarpaulin curtains, hunched in a too-small folding chair opposite a wiry neikonaut sporting a half-hood and pneumatic Rolex. An upended spool between them serves as a low table and is covered — as I suspect all surfaces in Mbetethi’s presence quickly are — with all kinds of neikological miscellany. My general impression is of a kind of loading-dock fortune teller’s booth, which is greatly enhanced by the fact that both men are hunched over a tiny, gleaming orb.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I don’t know how to knock on a tarp. I give it a little tug instead, and that’s when I realize there’s a third guy, must be six eight and on a diet of Russian hypertrophics, lurking behind it. He’s bald as a rock, a theme here, but somehow I doubt he’s a neikonaut. Somehow I doubt he’d fit in our scanner chair.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Hey,” he growls, arresting me by the shoulder and pushing me a full three feet backwards along the linoleum.“Don’t you know how to knock?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The wiry neikonaut, who is gazing at the orb in a kind of trance, doesn’t react. Mbetethi looks up and squints into the dim light, sounding utterly bored. “He’s still got ten minutes.” Signals the numeral with his hand. So I post up nearby, watching two people slice open a styrolite crate of coolant tanks and offer wildly different appraisals of its contents. And not five minutes later, the big guy gives me a gentle tap on the shoulder. “He’s ready for you.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Ten thousand,” Mbetethi says to the bottom of his glass when I enter. “For thirty minutes. If you are unable to hatch it in that time, go home and read Chapter 8 of K&amp;K, and we’ll try again, half off.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">His Mandarin has a pleasant Afro-French twinge to it. Though this is the most I’ve heard him speak, I recognize a certain three-four musicality from his tiles.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Let me see it,” I tell him. And to my surprise, still not really seeing me, he dips into a jacket pocket and tosses a grapefruit-sized orb of voxelite into the air. As it spins I get only the briefest glimpse of what’s inside — brilliant yellow jets like the sun’s rays, emanating from a black and beady core. In the same fluid motion, he catches the neikotic egg and it disappears with his hand beneath the table.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Ten thousand ping,” he repeats. “Half an hour.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I reach into my own bag, which our muscular friend does not like one bit, and produce Mbetethi’s N-1 license. “I was hoping we could arrange something?” I’m going for <i>listen, pal</i> but it comes out more <i>could I get an extension on this paper?</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I have dozens of these,” he laughs. “I —” Finally, he recognizes me. His face takes a round trip from mild surprise to pallid shock, and back again. “Dr. Xu — how did you — why —?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I’m not a doctor,” I grumble. “And I have something else for you, too.” I unzip my backpack and turn the contents onto the table with an extended, plasticky clatter. I imagine the scene through Mbetethi’s eyes, through any neikonaut’s eyes. First he catches the glint of voxelite, of a neikotic egg, a whole pile. That alpha, that new shit. Then he realizes it’s not an egg at all, but a perversion of the concept: hundreds of shards of neikotic debris. He recoils in horror, squeaks, even. I find myself pressed against the table with the whir of a vialgun at my neck.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It’s <i>fine</i>, Big Fish. It’s just voxelite. It’s fine.” But he can’t quite keep his eyes on the pile, nor look away from it. “Could you give us the room?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The hired muscle, who I tardily realize must be Big Fish, shrugs and wanders out. I scoot forward again, my pride scraped but not dented. At this point Mbetethi turns and folds his arms, conjuring detached amusement. “What kind of stupid are you, exactly? You realize this isn’t one of your poster sessions? No one is here handing out stress balls, and little clicky clicky pens with the names of benzodiazepines?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I regard the egg, which Mbetethi is now sort of sitting on. “That thing of yours has made my life a living hell over the last week.” Not strictly true. It’s made it more interesting. But I pronounce this so with dramatic effect. “Do you have any idea how many people you’ve sent to my clinic? This is how you repay me for pulling that shit out of you?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Thank you for saving me.” He says this quite seriously, and lets it hang in the air for a moment. “How many?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I...<i>I</i> don’t know! More than a hundred at this point.” I jab at the table. “Count ‘em.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That number seems to surprise him. “And I suppose one of them led you here,” he ventures, sounding a tiny bit betrayed.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“<i>One of them</i> had a grand mal seizure! Ruptures in his cranial arteries! Plus — it’s Double Descent, dude.” I wave my arm around vaguely, as if totally unimpressed with Shanghai’s neikological black market. “It’s actually kind of lame.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Just one of them?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“<i>Just</i> one of them?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Well, look at the numbers.” He says this so earnestly, so evenly, that I have no choice but to direct my attention to the numbers. “This class of algorithm is known to produce bad neikotic debris. Comes with the territory. I even make them sign a little release form, just like you.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Really?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Of course not. The point is that probably one in a hundred really serious bits of debris has a nasty neurological complication. You said you’ve seen a hundred patients, so I’m right in the money! Am I not?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I fold my arms.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I am making them <i>rich</i>...” He waves his hand lazily, clearly forgetting something.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Mona. Like the painting.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I am making them <i>rich</i>, Mona. They are going out there and tearing holes in the polyquasal derivatives market, in counterfactuals, in forex. Some of them will probably retire. They understand the risks! A little brain hemorrhage...bing, bang, <i>et voilà. </i>A giant vacation home in Bali.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He sounds so much like a proud scout leader that my original theory is going out of focus. Mbetethi — the name sounds Gabonese, and the accent sure sounds French. Was it so crazy to assume that it was a malicious act on his part, a<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>poisoning of Suowei Financial’s best and brightest for the havoc they brought upon his home country?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“So let me learn it.” I lean across the table, look him square in the eyes. “Give me thirty minutes with it. Hell, give me fifteen for five thousand.” Do I even have five thousand ping? Maybe, kinda. “I’m a YINS neikologist, I’ve got a little guangpan in me, and I just read Chapter 8 of K&amp;K.” I’m bluffing wildly, and Mbetethi is absolutely eating it up. But he shakes his head calmly.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Not you.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Oh? Not me?” I keep my eyes steady on his. In fact, I’m having a hard time tearing them away, and it seems he is too. It seems that a tiny, jerking oscillation passes between us as he gauges my intent.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Because you’re going to write a paper about it. Tell me you’re not.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I can’t tell him I’m not. But I’m getting genuinely irked at this point, not just at those brilliant pearly whites, that amused indifference, but at the way something about our time in the Deng Bridge lingers in this conversation, in the faint xylophonic interplay of the tiles behind the words. Something <i>happened</i> while I was in the diving-bell, something neither of us can remember. I am made to feel as though, last we met, I yanked a tooth from him without warning or consent. He knows it, I know it, and he knows I know it, and it’s driving me crazy that I don’t know how to just bring it up.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Well, I think it’s the least you could do,” I insist, tilted, my voice curling at the edges. “You’re <i>poisoning</i> all these people and sending them to me to fix. God knows I hate Suowei Financial as much as anyone else in Shanghai —”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“No you do not. But I am not so vengeful as you think.” Mbetethi’s speech is suddenly flat and guarded, and my stomach burbles with an admixture of phenethylamine and regret. Had I been aiming for that nerve? Just what had I even said aloud? “And if you’re going to —”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">From far away in the building, perhaps on an upper floor, there’s a clatter, as though of cookware hitting folding chairs. To me it sounds like nothing of note, but for him, it’s more than enough. “They’re coming,” he says, in that same flattened voice. He’s scooping the contents of the table into a backpack, and briefly I get one last look at that brilliant golden orb.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“<i>Who’s</i> coming?” He doesn’t reply. “<i>Mbetethi!</i>”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I absolutely bungle the first consonant, and that’s what he responds to, snapping, zipping. “It’s just <i>Tethi.</i> Teth, if you like. I like to sprinkle...”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Will you please just tell me...”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“...extra bits in there. Throws ‘em off. Is it me, <i>n’est-ce pas moi</i>, <i>wo ye bu zhidao</i>. Get your stuff, ‘cause in a second —”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There’s a <i>tink-tink-tink</i> as, above us, the lights go out. There’s a pneumatic hiss as, God, I dunno — the doors seal up? Behind me, Tethi rips down the curtain, and all I can see is an eye-level orange-red, dozens of pairs of Contecs bobbing in the dark. Muffled voices, shouting, more clash-clang-bang. The clamor that was so distant a minute ago is now a short distance away. I wouldn’t last a day here. I scoop as much debris as I can back into my backpack.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Evacuating in sixty seconds,” someone shouts, but my Mandarin must be doing guangpan barrel rolls because it’s the wrong<i> evacuate</i>, it’s the one that has to do with test chambers and pressure differentials. On the far end of the pitch-black space, an even pitcher blacker space opens up, damp and cold and somehow a little windy. I stumble over spools and stools, trying to keep up. <i>How does everyone know where they’re going?</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It’s <i>her!</i>” That barking voice, charged with amphetamines, and not the touchy-feely kind. Every hair on my body stands unit-normal jump-scare upright as I realize that its owner, who I cannot see, must be pointing at <i>me</i>. “She led them right here! We oughtta leave her inside for them to find!”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A few interested pairs of Contecs turn my way, but Tethi grabs my shoulder. “<i>Shenjing bing</i>, paranoid freaks,” he snarls. “<i>Gun kai</i>. Fuck all the way off.” And then, now leading me around a floor covered with abandonware, he growls, “It had better not be you.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Tethi. Teth. <i>What is going on?</i>”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“What do you think?” he whips back. And, hell, it’s a fair question. The clamor is close enough that I can pick out individual voices; I imagine a great katamari of riot armor and laser sights rolling our way.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Evacuation in five.” The voice is close and unamplified. We straggle through what I reckon, proprioceptively, as a large door. “Four...three...”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Listen to me.” He points up the contours of a stairwell. “This leads directly to the top of the building. They’ll be waiting outside, so you need to get above ground level, as many floors as you can. Wait ‘em out. Don’t be caught here.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You’re not serious.” There’s a another hiss behind us and I raise my voice to a shout. “I don’t even have Contecs!”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tethi is a pair of blinking orange circles. And then he’s nothing at all. “Don’t find me,” he warns. He pushes through self-imposed darkness, through the damp and gathered human throng. I can tell he’s trying to hide it, but by some blindsight I also realize he’s going the opposite way: down the stairs. The crowd moves forward at an uncertain pace, but near its rear I feel no tempo, no pressure, and I stumble towards the walls. A few countervailing figures, total darknesses, brush past me. A few sets of descending footsteps echo Tethi’s — descending to where?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">With another layer of doors between us the clamor of voices is more muffled than before, but I hear one last thing as I make my sudden and frantic choice, up or down, up or down: <i>“By order of the Weather Bureau, open up!”</i></p>\n</section>",

            "content_html": "<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">Down.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I mean, c’mon.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There’s no change to the utter darkness, but there’s a tactile shift after three flights: the stairways are no longer concrete and standpipe, but rough-hewn narrow things, mineral-damp, railing-free. I keep my hands in front of my face, warding off dangling conduit, imagining spiderweb and live wires. Of course I have a light on me, but I’m terrified of drawing any attention to myself. Just above the Weather Bureau manages to violently unseal that door — the fucking <i>Weather Bureau, </i>Mona! W<i>hat are you doing here?</i> So I creep downward, my choice made, letting the guangpan draw subtle constellations of purple across my darkness, trying to keep footsteps within earshot. But they’re already dampening and fanning out. The tunnels level out and are already branching, and I’ve made how many unknowing choices? Three? Four? I hold one hand out against the darkness, and the other traces the wall. The slimy, chalky texture accumulating on my fingers confirms what I already know.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The silence becomes the darkness, and finally, inevitably, I am alone.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But, God, isn’t this what I had always wanted?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It’s called Ripplechasing, not Chalker-chasing. But back in that brief and brilliant period of my life, we all understood tacitly that finding one involved seeking the other. The Chalkers were where the Ripples were. They moved with them at night, or they moved them at night — the language of causality fails here, and that’s just how they like it. Cai Yuhui chased for a firebug, scattershot kind of fame, a knack for finding and being found, for showing up one minute before the Ripple with legions watching through her eyes. I wanted the opposite. I wanted to feel the adoring gaze of the city and not refract it one bit. I wanted to be made of glass. We orbited it, on a high ecliptic, all for our own reasons, for togetherness, for bounties, for cardio. But the Chalkers operated inside of it, and we watched their operations from a safe distance, warped and distorted and lensed, always feeling nervously for an event horizon.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Of course we knew about the tunnels.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We knew that they were everywhere, and that they were no one’s idea. We knew that, in Xia’s day, they had been the first whispered sign in the halls of power that something was askance in the daily, rolling five-year plans produced by the language models that were to interpret the Mirror Sea.<i> We’re building how many new subway lines?</i> someone finally thought to ask. <i>How many sewer mains?</i> But by the time they found the Ripples lurking in the system’s hidden layers, legions of tunnel-boring machines were in the ground. By the time Xia Zitian took to that podium to confess, some of those tunnels had tracks, and some of them periodically flooded. And now they’re all covered in chalk.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I’m afraid to look, and I’m afraid not to.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Lining the ceiling at luxuriously close intervals are bulbous teardrop cameras, clustered in fours, infrared sensors trained on the walls. They see — <i>they</i> see, Mona — chalk dripping imperceptibly slowly down the wet walls. And yet I know this, and I see it too. Flashes, jet-gnostic, more blindsight: hallucinatory scribbles in knots and hooks and whorls, for what feels like infinity in both directions. It’s the color of nothing, the same one I so faintly perceive from the LEDs ringing the cameras, infrared leaking into the visible spectrum. But is the chalk really that reflective? Or...or something else?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It only grows clearer in my mind’s eye. My stumbling becomes something more confident. With a lurch I realize that I’ve stopped feeling the wall: I’ve been relying on this unsight, this delusion, that I can see the contours of the tunnel. <i>But I can.</i> The chalk picks up definite form. <i>You’re just imagining it.</i> But it’s losing its wobbly stochast. It radiates with a brightness that is simply not here, in subtle and prismatic separations. I see it, and navigate by it, with hundred-watt surety that only makes it clearer. A familiar loop tightens.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I’m afraid not to look: <i>You need to turn your camera flash on. Just see that you’re just hallucinating this. This is the parabola, Mona, you don’t want this, not now, not here...</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I’m afraid to look: <i>Mona, do you or do you not still believe that the Chalker tunnels are a sacred space, a quiet place, where the Ripples go at night to dream?</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A wedge in my throat. Just a peek. I ignite the flash.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And I just barely suppress a scream (<i>of horror? of loosening delight?</i>) when I see that the chalk on the walls matches my unsight precisely. That down here I do not need light to see. A flaring realization that this bright light trained on such sensitive cameras is as a weapon to the Ripples — <i>you’re blinding them!</i> But no. Not blinding them. <i>Burning</i> them, more like, with an LED-singed hole in their foundational rhythms.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Blame it on the guangpan, if you want. Blame it on that dull golden spikiness, softened these few days but still lodged inside my logic. Blame it on my battery: eleven percent. I kill the flash. I still see the chalk.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">An afterimage, sure, but an afterimage that moves as my head does, that doesn’t care if my eyes are open or closed. Here I float, at the Lagrange point between reason and madness. Here I strike the bedrock of Shanghai’s garden of delusion, that indifference to the difference between correlation and causation, between light and sight. And as I take my first steps forward — <i>what else am I supposed to do?</i> — the chalk begins to wiggle, to accumulate, to integrate into a dull red glow. It’s, it’s...<i>it’s not too late to turn your flash back on. There’s got to be a manhole, a ladder, a quick way out...</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But all uncertainty is subsumed now by this: <i>you’ve been so, so good.</i> <i>You’re been so good, for so long.</i> I walk faster, the walls clearly in sight, now positively crawling with texture, meaning thrumming in harp-struck primary colors behind my eyes<i>. It’s been more than a year now and you’ve barely, barely peeked. You upended your routines, you moved apartments, you holed yourself inside.</i> The red is starting to peel apart into other colors, unflattening into browns and greens. <i>You even made a friend here, and you gave that up too.</i> The color is peeling off the wall, into the tunnel itself, becoming the tunnel itself. <i>And for what, Mona?</i> I can still feel my legs breaking into a long stride and then a run, but only barely. I am the blurry fact of motion, a disturbance along an axis, an implementation detail. <i>You’re going out. You’re joining in.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I burst out of the tunnel at breakneck speed, in a dozen different places, at a dozen different moments. It’s not that I don’t know where I am — quite the opposite. A footbridge across the trickling Zhangjiang, a wide and windy Century Avenue, a shed near a burbling fountain outside a great metro station. I recognize all these places, but they’re<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>mere floaters in my eyes as I unfurl myself into the city to see and be seen, to decorate a hundred walls. A second sun erupts diode by diode to soak Shanghai’s streets in soap-bubble suchness for anyone who cares to simply stop and see. The rain has passed, and the dead of night is not dead at all.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I am a mossy maelstrom of butterflies and antlers and roots and cilia, in which nothing persists for longer than a moment before decaying elegantly into something new. Snail palm shells fronds. Periwinkle is not a color it's my whole circulatory system inhaling blooming exhaling decaying into the barnacular the tentacular, a recurring negative space in creation. Briefly, of all things, I am even <i>people</i>. In my selfishness, in my insistence of primacy, I see a hand in front of a face, but I simply let go of that miserly fool, who ever dared think a single atom or joule could ever belong to her. Velveteen cycles of creation and destruction, wing and bone, lit gently and obliquely from nowhere at all. A hawk, a mouse, and a mushroom are eating each other, and this strange loop is my shoulder? No, someone is shaking my shoulder...</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Hey, it’s <i>you</i>!”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I remember this woman...with the dress made of traffic-cone shells...from the elevator at Double Descent. These facts were never absent, not really, but a detail snaps into focus, and that detail is Mona Xu. <i>It never lasts, the way it lasts...</i>that’s my sad absurd little thought, but she’s beaming at me with a joy that says I know you, that says let’s go ’til morning, and maybe it’s not so bad, suddenly, to be a detail in such eyes, dark velvet wrapped in orange-red reassurance. Maybe there are hours to go.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“We think we know where it’s headed.” Her hand wraps, soft and a little clammy, around my wrist. “Let’s move.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I manage to tear my eyes away from the gigantic quasigram along god-knows-what boulevard, feeling the awful kink in my neck, seeing outer tendrils of the Ripple flickering in the scan lines. It looks like — well, a little of everything. It’s a carnival of pareidolia: wings and bones and roots, always already dead. I see it reflected in her dress, in the the fixpoint snailshell shapes designed to tag the Ripple, to make it through the slice-and-dice of the Mirror Sea’s anonymization algorithm unscathed. I see it in the garments of the other Ripplechasers scattering down the street, and — what on earth is this? — in the wreath of dried flowers that someone’s plunked onto my head. Back in my day, we had been going for a coral reef look. But maybe that had been too on the nose.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The last wisp of the Ripple disappears. It’s fair to say that the next thing I know, I’m somewhere else entirely.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hours later, when it’s finally plain old me, my big question is how I got across the river. I started in Pudong and now, with the sun rising across my back, I am walking through deep Puxi, just one ward from home. I suffer not a dearth of memory, but an excess, a hypermemory. In its facets I take the Metro and walk a footbridge and even hang hooting and hollering from the side of a veetle. Are any of these mine? Are they even real? The comedown felt like a pleasant, lazy slide that narrowed, and narrowed me, until I <i>plunked</i> irreversibly back into my own subjectivity. Trying to peer back up it now, it seems impossibly steep. Part of it is pride, too. If we had managed to move a Ripple across the Huangpu, I can’t help but think, that was damn fine work.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">My last Ripplechasing stint ended in disaster, in a graduate dormitory suite waist deep with water from every tap I could open. I also had to take a class. <i>Remedial belief modulation</i>, in a building across town; its drabness only fed my suspicion that it was Weather Bureau headquarters. The instructor drew a squeaky parabola on the board and wrote the words: QUADRATIC BELIEF. You give it <i>this</i> much, he explained, and it gives you <i>that</i> back squared, and so you feed it and feed it. Yes, <i>you</i> in the back, you personally. We had all shown ourselves susceptible to quadratic belief, and we were all to avoid so much as thinking about the Mirror Sea — nevermind that we could see it through the window blinds — as it was a canvas on which we might paint any delusion, any fantasy, any distortion of consensus reality.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But once in a while, maybe that’s what I need.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">After days of rain the sweetness of the sun tinges our world, drying the damp from my YINS hoodie, calming the shiver in my bones. It touches their world, too. Projected stories high on the wall of a parking ramp, the Sea erupts with fragmentary, concentric bursts of orange in all the places you don’t expect. You could intuit a lot about the operation of the Lam-Waldmann Hash by watching these blooms. Or at least someone could. <i>I’m</i> freezing and hungry and focused on remembering how to use my feet. The Ripples are properly out now, in ordinary textures of traffic and street cleaning and middle managers on morning jogs. Against my better judgement I stop and stare, one more time, grasping for that slippery impression of how it felt to see one through fifty pairs of eyes at once. Of how they’re <i>really </i>shaped.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A tiny pipsqueak of a thing nips at the edge of a much larger Ripple. This is to be expected. When two Ripples collide, sloshed or jostled or maybe egged on, they interfere, flaying each others’ outer layers into decoherence. Whether this is fucking or fighting or finnicking, that’s above my pay grade. But we can all at least agree that it obeys the principles of wave mechanics, and that it makes for a hell of a show. The little one might be a wake-parasite, hitching a ride on the big one’s motile force. It might be a small part of a larger self, trying desperately to recohere before being forgotten in the churn. It might —</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I stop dead in my tracks, look and look again. There’s no way.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“<i>Crazies</i>!” A delivery driver squeals to a stop in front of me, hollering out the window. “Lowlife nutcases!”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I’m across two lanes of traffic, four, dashing across the street to get a better look at that tiny blob before it flits away. Now I’m right up against the screen, the heat of individual pixels, craning my neck. The way the blob undulates, the zebra-stripe patterns that thrum concentrically along it, are more than familiar — much more than familiar. <i>This </i>is quadratic belief, this is the shallow of the parabola and <i>you need to look away right now</i> because it’s only gonna get deeper. But I barely even blink. I drink in the sight until I’m either absolutely sure, or sure I’ve lost it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Lens blur, undertow, vertigo: something pulls on my attention, and I realize the blob isn’t chasing the larger Ripple at all. It refocuses on something else, its movement tracking my attention all too precisely.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Waterfall-curtains of it, the gentle-twinkling golden of it, the clawing, spiraling, murmuring of it. <i>I know I’ve seen these shapes before</i>: the thought unfurls unbidden, prophecy into fact. I <i>have</i> seen it before, now, in Tethi’s tiles and the shards in my backpack and even now, half-submerged in my own depths. And now I see it in the Mirror Sea: kelplike strands of Material #110, sieve debris. And orbiting it, probing it, that flashing blob knows its only purpose, seeks an opening. <i>Am I really seeing this or is it just in my head but the difference is no difference the question is no longer fun it’s a pit it’s a parabola...</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There’s a flash: a loopback whisper — <i>holdingonletgo</i> — and the debris is gone. Gone from the screen, gone from my mind’s eye, gone from their brief and terrifying confluence. And from that paraeidolic maw, from that churn of everything and nothing, the diving-bell has disappeared as well.</p>\n</section>",

            "content_html": "<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">It was gone. It was gone. It was in the chalk and the feeds and the texture of time itself, and then it was simply gone. All day I’d been outside looking for it: the sigil on the wall of it, the knowing glance of it. It was gone, I realized, from Cai’s feed. April was becoming May, Shanghai was heating up. Something new groaned in the loam, waiting to be born. <i>The city was no longer a coral reef.</i> Nothing lives forever, much less a Ripple. Where was Cai?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>It was early morning, blue-gray dawn, spring-dew already steaming off the grass. I was back in Beiwan, finally. I was out of the veetle and on foot, dashing down the streets, glancing sidelong at the displays, hoping for some remnant of the old one, some death-throes to tide her over. A million things to remember. A million things to let go of, but not this one please not this one. I hadn’t warned her about the crash, the withdrawal, the jump. We could make this one together hand in hand, I was thinking, but that wasn’t true. I had seen the right moment because that’s what I do. I had already lept.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Cai was on her feeds last night, I realized, chasing something new. The thing we inhabited together was groaning invisibly all around me, collapsing under its own weight. And now she was offline god knows where god knows what. And I was a receiver for a dead frequency, sole survivor of a dead world, whole mindways dangling limp and useless. I had checked everywhere. I stood in the dead-center of the Scrambler for hours, scanning fruitlessly for it, baking in asphalt-heat, roasting in my scales and jewels. Now the truth was undeliable. The grief came over me incomprable unthinkable in horrible waves I retch salt I sob tides. The Ripple, our Ripple, had died. I was undergoing apoptosis.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>The Ripple had died and there was nothing I could do. I am a galemaker and a forecaster, I pull and am pulled. I could have bought it a day at most, sure — but a day in which to warn her. Where had I been all night? And why was the lobby so wet? Wetter than any spring drizzle would explain, water burbling down the stairs, out of the elevator. Up one landing, two, I never take the stairs, but it was leaking from doors on every floor. It wasn’t just her facing this loss and maybe just maybe it wasn’t her at all. But 8E here the floor wet the keycard I pushed on the door and something pushed back, something sloshed back, I finally got it open and it rushed around us, thigh deep. There she was with her hand on the tap.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It was actually more like waist deep but I guess that depends on, oh God, there were two of us, and which was I? Only with Cai’s eyes I finally saw what I was doing, that the entire flat was filled with water. Every tap had been running for hours, since I got home, and just how long had that been? Dawn broke it danced on the surface of the shallow of the sea but the illusion faltered, I got one last glimpse of myself, this ridiculous getup, this veil of aquamarine. Then I only saw her, sloshing forward, reaching for me. But someone was behind us.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Not them not now oh please there’s still time to get her out. I could take the hit the blame it should have been me...</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But there was no time at all. The Weather Bureau was already in the building, already there to mop up the damage. Probably this same scene was playing out all across the city. Behind Cai came shouting, footfall, irridescent visors, vialguns. They were in the stairwell, in the hallway, and then — the moment stretched like a rubber band and finally, painfully snapped — in the doorframe behind her.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I found my hands in the water and raised them slowly and deliberately into the air.</p>\n</section>",

            "content_html": "<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">Once in the backseat, age twelve or so and bored to death by the Pacific Coast Highway, I saw a UFO. I remember two phosphorically bright balls spinning around each other on a fixed axis, hurtling away from the night. <i>Mom! Dad! </i>But by the time I had their attention, it was lost in the sunset. At the time the Air Force was still overflying California, slow-rolling down the street like a jealous ex, but with <i>that?</i> My mind reeled over the implications. I was certain this would upend my whole impression of the cosmos, soft as it still was. And then I took a brief nap. Fifteen minutes later I was on my phone, and the UFO was something that had happened to someone else.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This is the strategy. It doesn’t work. I wake up to a 10 AM alarm, still in my street clothes and smelling of tunnel. I force myself to get a good look in the mirror — <i>this</i> is you, you are <i>here</i> — and not to feel the relief when it fogs over.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Over and over I return to what I saw on that screen. I push heedlessly through the metro. At first I keep my eyes dead ahead during the transfer at Century Avenue. Then I cave. I scan the endless, scrolling Mirror Sea displays for any sign of the diving-bell, striding backwards along the moving walkways. <i>Maybe it’s a common thing</i>, a visual motif in the Sea I never noticed before. Maybe there’s some mathematical reason. I imagine striding into my meeting with Deng in seventeen and a half minutes and asking about it. <i>Oh, I was out chasing last night and I saw the diving-bell floating around in the Sea. What’s the deal with that? </i>I can hardly imagine a faster way to infuriate her.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Twenty-six minutes later I burst through her door. I’m certain she can smell the mania and fatigue on me. I wonder if I still have dried flowers in my hair. Deng says nothing about my tardiness, but for someone who wants no part in my paper, she suddenly has lots to say about that. She slides me a rollscroll displaying nine neat equations.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“What am I looking at?” My voice is hoarse and guarded and somehow askew.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“What do you think?” she asks, mild and nonjudgmental.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">”They’re...solutions to a wave equation?” This is an incredibly vague answer, but Deng accepts it cheerfully and then swipes over to a graphing program. There I see something vividly, horribly familiar, undulating and tessellating in place. She stares at me, waiting for a reaction. It takes me ten full seconds to remember I’m not being accused of a crime.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“These are...”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She doesn’t want to say it, and that’s how I know.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“...the diving-bell,” I surmise.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“The inversion capsule you generated in loop-lock with your first patient,” she assents, steering hard around my pet name for the thing. “I’m deriving a version of it from scratch. It will work just the same way, only it won’t be...” <i>Me.</i> It won’t be a little piece of me.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I thought you didn’t want anything to do with this.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Well forgive my curiosity!” A new problem always puts her in a nice mood, and she says this theatrically, angling for a laugh. Her smile fades, though, watching me. “Are you all right?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Yeah-no-I’m-fine-really, just-didn’t-get-much-sleep-is-all, this-looks-great.</i> I stumble through five more minutes of this. And later on, I try to make this sound like a parting afterthought: “Hey, could I get a copy of those equations?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">At lunchtime I pace around campus, elbowing through undergrads and glaring at the ones whose getups betray an interest in Ripplechasing trends. I do two circuits, buying a zongzi and a protein bar and eating neither. Something occurs to me: the golden-black spikiness in my head is gone. Was it possibly that microdose of guangpan? Or, just now, staring at Deng’s model in soberspace, was that enough? Or — let’s not be coy about the delusion chasing its own tail around my mind here — did the diving-bell find me in the Mirror Sea this morning, and deliver the inversion then?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">What’s frustrating is that there’s a way to get an objective answer about what I saw or didn’t see in the Sea, and it’s right here at YINS. I just don’t want to go up there. But halfway through my third lap, I groan inwardly and call the elevator for the top floor of Building 6. <i>Please don’t be there,</i> I pray. <i>Please be streaming a daychase, or eating a whole bucket of chicken fry and not getting bloated, or whatever it is you do. Just not here.</i></p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">I first visited the Observatory during orientation, but of course it was Cai Yuhui who finally got me to come to a showing here. Of course, the Observatory is not just the projection system, not really. It’s YINS’ massive network of Mirror Sea feed subscriptions and exclusive leases. The neikonauts who comb them for footage — mathematicians or biologists, depending on who you ask — just happen to produce gems like <i>Interference Patterns: The Birth of a Ripple</i> and duds like <i>Hyperlagmites: The Sea At Night. </i>I’m embarrassed to say I still have the stub. Today, the domed theater looks almost abandoned. The box office is closed, the Now Showing board empty, and although I have been very diligently <i>not thinking about it</i>, I realize I haven’t seen any flyers or banners advertising this place for a while.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But there are signs of life at the back office. Light through the blinds, for one. A wastebin full of styrolite coffee cups, and the muffled whir of UTMS scanners. <i>Please don’t be there</i>. I re-up my plea, and knock.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">No one comes to the door for a while. I knock again, a notoriously poor way to get the attention of someone in a CPU-bound psychedelic trance. YINS doors have little buzzers to get the attention of someone in loop-lock — and if you ever, ever use one, <i>tong fengwo</i>, poke the beehive — well, there’d better be a fire. I gaze up at the security camera in the corner: a perfectly ordinary one, though someone with a sense of humor has dangled a few red prayer cards from its stem. Maybe they’re inside, watching, waiting for me to leave so they can go pee. I get it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Just as I turn to go, a woman hefting a box of cold-storage drives rounds the corner and stops short when she sees me. “Help you?” she grunts, red-faced.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Are you with the Observatory?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She glances me over, at my YINS tank and my general grubbiness, and seems to weigh putting down what looks like a very heavy box. “Yes I am. Do you have an appointment?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>I tell her no...that I’m a student...that I’ve always heard YINS affiliates can get some observatory time...that I’m happy to make an appointment and come back, yada yada. As I wind on, I infer from her skeptical expression that they must field this exact request about six times a day. “By the way, what happened to the theater?” I finish, trying to sound less deranged. “I loved the soundtracks, you could just melt into your chair...”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This seems to crack her. She sighs wistfully. “It attracted the bad kind of attention. Some people, you give ‘em a little taste, and they keep coming back for more. The public, definitely. But people from campus, with the craziest ideas in their heads about the Ripples. We give them an hour of footage, and they’d come back demanding eight hours in loop-lock. We’d have to pry them off the rig, call campus security and sometimes the...well, you know.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Neither of us are very subtle about looking each other over for telltale signs. Some of them change with the trends, with the Ripples of the moment — wickervine arm wraps and tessel trainer treads and, well, I try not to know about all this. Others are timeless: sigils and notches and embeds, a certain forever-faraway look in the eyes. This woman has none of those. With her chunky black frames and striped T-shirt filling out her overalls, she’s determined to look and sound like she moved from the countryside last week. Me? Well, I finally had my coral sigil tattoo lasered over, and you can only see the scars in the right light...</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She purses her lips, deferring judgement. “Anyway. Lots of wards are trying to claw back their feeds. <i>We’re </i>fine, I mean, but they’re still adding riders to the leases, tight access controls and all that. And with undergrads now, and half of them wannabe chasers, I’m sorry to say we have a new policy on guest observation slots. You’ll need a faculty member to sign off on your request.” She blinks, possibly for the first time. “Who are you with? I’m Yue Fang, by the way.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Finally Yue Fang unlocks the office, drops her drives onto a couch, and fetches a tablet for me to fill out “just a liiittle bit of paperwork”. The waiting area is spartan, and behind it is a long hall of closed doors. Only tight timetables pasted up on A4 paper provide any hint of what goes on here. I peer glumly at the tablet and the twenty-eight places it says I need to sign.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I wonder,” I begin, breaking a weird and humming silence. “If it helps at all, I don’t actually want to enter loop-lock myself. It’d actually save me a bunch of time if I didn’t. What I want is to search the Sea for a particular pattern. Is that something you could just do for me?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I wave a thumb drive loaded with Deng’s mathematical model of the diving-bell. Yue looks thoughtful, looks around at all the nothing in the room. She looks back at me, newly curious. “Who did you say your advisor was?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And of course now is when Cai Yuhui appears in the hallway.</p>\n</section>",

            "content_html": "<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Mona,” Cai says, falling-rising. And I feel the spring-load of the moment, the outrush of months of coiled potential energy. But now, crushing devastation: in her eyes I see the same mechanism fail to fire. Nothing was leading up to this. She never wondered what this moment would be like. I am a problem to be solved. Yue Fang looks at me, then at her, and after trying to broker a pleasantry or two decides she really needs to file those drives.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Cai looks right into my clockwork and softly but perceptibly sighs. “Can I talk to you outside?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Outside</i> is a balcony ringing the dome of Building 6. Cai holds the door open for me, which I don’t like. But I don’t mind the pre-autumnal crispness up here, the cool breeze off the Huangpu’s tesselatory chop. I squint; her Contecs go real reflective. “Why are you here?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It’s good to see you, too, Yuhui.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“If it’s good to see me, <i>call.</i> Or pick up the phone. When I heard your voice in the hall just now, my heart dropped<i>.</i> After all this time, this is where you come to find me? What am I supposed to think?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“This is where you work. This is —” And I gesture sharply at...all of her. Cai is a walking map of Ripplechasing culture from the top of her head downward. Oh, all tasteful, of course. Her hair is pure, shocking white. Those sigils are done in neuro-fade ink, probably wiped and remapped every six months. Her long, folded arms, her almost cranelike neck, are ringed with minimalist strata, topaz and bone. Six or seven layers up, I see coral. The Mirror Sea is Cai’s research and her hobby, her livelihood twice over. I always found it hard to see another aspect of her that wasn’t just...this.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I think she takes that point only too well. “Don’t act like you’re here to see me. What’s on the drive?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“What’s in the Mirror Sea?” I ask. Confusion blits over her Contecs. I press now, lightheaded, welcoming the thick of it: “No, I’m completely serious! Why is the entire Observatory holing up all of a sudden?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“The ward —”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“The wards would tell you something. They’d be coming to you for answers.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“The Ward Council,” she finishes flatly, “passed a flimsy paperwork barrier to keep live feeds out of the hands of <i>teenagers</i>. Who are coming from out-zone and getting a first exposure to loop-lock <i>and</i> DMT. Do you ever talk to the first-years? Do you see that their realities are getting broken this week? If, on top of that, we’re promoting the Mirror Sea all over campus some of them are going to snap.” Snap, Mona, like you did. “Of course we’re scaling back.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Suddenly I don’t feel good, no, not at all. One moment I’m leaning on the balcony and the next I’m retching — dry-heaving, because what have even I eaten in the last day? And that becomes a loud, ugly sob, and then a train of silent ones, and now Cai grabs me by the wrist. “I fucked up bad,” I choke out. “I went chasing last night...”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For the one long awful second it takes her to process this, she continues to glare at me. Then she blinks her Contecs off so I can see her pupils. Her mouth forms a small, nearly silent <i>oh.</i> But if there’s any disbelief on her face, it’s probably that I held out this long.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">”I didn’t mean to. I didn’t seek it out.” But didn’t I? Didn’t I skulk around for nights, hoping it would find me? And isn’t that exactly how it works — wait, <i>isn’t it?</i><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>“And now, I, I can’t tell what I saw in there...”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I am so, so embarrassed by how readily I fell to quadratic belief. One night! My mind feels so slippery, like I have perfect leeway to <i>choose</i> to the truth, not just myself but for the world, and I slip-slide dangerously down the parabola, gaining a tiny bit of traction only in admitting what had happened. Pathetic! Cai lives her life night and day on the razor’s edge of delusion, and never a hair out of place, and me — and <i>me</i> —</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tears seem to well up, but they don’t come. Cai remains still with me, grasping my arms, waiting me out. She stands fully upright; I’m doing enough slouching for the both of us.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It’s not just you.” She’s suddenly much quieter, could pass for her own echo. “Who struggles with it, I mean. Remember the Ripple we rode together? Remember how we sat around and just <i>talked</i> about it? I mean, it was nothing, but it was everything, it was…” Words fail her. The coral sigil along her forearm pulses darker for a few beats of her heart. “It felt amazing, and so it felt even better to share it. But sometimes there’s something you don’t want to see in there, and it hurts to think about, and that’s the other side of it.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I snort, amused. “You’re saying I’d better keep it to myself.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I’m not!” But Cai comes to a full stop and seems to really consider this. “Well, maybe I am, a little. It’s just — when quadratic belief gets bad, talking about it can make it worse. More real. For you, and for other people, too.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yeah. They said exactly this in Remedial Belief Modulation.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“But I’m glad you’re telling me about it. In the abstract. And Mona,” she goes on, with her usual quickness, “your incident last year was my own fault too. There were things that I thought wouldn’t go wrong that time. I should have prepared you.” For a moment, Cai Yuhui’s apparatus of psychological dazzle camouflage falters. Something besides pure poise cracks into her voice, her posture, and in the candelabraic flickering of her Contecs (this reminds me too much of the diving-bell, and I look away). I see a vessel with no lid, filled to the brim, trying with every careful motion not to spill. I cling to the idea that this glimpse under the skin, this dropped frame, was intentional. The next moment, it’s gone.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I should have been with you that night. And I’m sorry.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You should have,” I agree. I don’t know why this comes out of me. Not for blame’s sake.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“And I wish I could do more for you right now, but you’re right, I’m inseparable from it. I’m a walking extension of the Mirror Sea.” <i>Had I said that out loud?</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Just promise you won’t call the Weather Bureau on me?” I mean it as a joke, but the last thing I need is two more nights in custody, interchangeable men asking a battery of interchangeable questions, peering through the cracks in my sanity — in the worst moments, I recall, almost trying to pry them open...</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Cai frowns. “You don’t think it was <i>me</i> who<i> </i>called them last time!”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Well,” I sigh. “No. I don’t.” But in truth it crossed my mind once or twice, in the weeks and months afterwards. How closely behind her they arrived.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Mona Xu.” She puts a hand on each of my shoulders. “I am your friend, and even if I wasn’t, I would never call the Weather Bureau on you. They’ll wall up every mind in the city if we let them. Maybe they’ll even find a way to take down the displays. But they’ll never ever take down the cameras, because they’re the real addicts, the ones who really can’t let it go. They have nothing else. You do.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Another frame drops; Cai looks faintly sad and very tired.</p>\n</section>",

            "content_html": "<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">In Weather Bureau custody, one of the interchangeable men had steered me down an interchangeable hallway to a room with dark walls instead of white. Properly speaking there was no lighting at all in there. A woman sat on the floor, surely uncomfortable, cross-legged in her pantsuit. She gestured for me to take a seat and the door clicked behind me. No light bled in from around it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“YINS, right?” She wore their standard-issue iridescent visor over her eyes, but for the first time that night I caught a sliver of a smile underneath it. “I suppose you might know what these are?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I could still see her, despite the surrounding dark, because the floor between us was cluttered with devices of illumination: triangular pieces, lights and mirrors and prisms. Fifty, maybe.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“No,” I replied, half-dazed.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“That’s all right.” Her voice was calm, like she was speaking to a child. “I’ll show you.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I don’t remember the rules to the game, and for my purposes now they’re not important. But I spent more than an hour on the floor learning them: the names of and legal placement of the different optical elements. Then I was allowed to manipulate them, heavy and angular, to grok the possible moves. In all of this she said little about how to win.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Finally she arranged the pieces in three overlapping circles. The Weather Bureau had pumped me full of antipattern agents some hours before, and by then they were wearing off, leaving me flattened and indifferent. Under their influence it had been impossible to recognize the gestalt of human faces: she surprised me in several ways, taking off her visor so I could see her eyes.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You go first.” She offered advantage, or maybe not.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I tried my best, which in my condition was not saying so much. I understood the moves she made, and nodded to show it; I never saw what they added up to. The balance of the light began to shine in my direction. Maybe thirty moves in, I saw some crazy gambit. My hands were probably shaking as I arranged two mirrors and a prism equilaterally, shining a bit of light back her way. “Not bad,” she offered, breaking an extended silence. And then she placed an important-looking piece, its LEDs glowing in three directions, and won the game. <i>This is stupid, </i>I should have thought. <i>This is meaningless.</i> But in the moment it was everything, and I felt exposed, surrounded bodily, floodlit from above. It was dysphoric and claustrophobic, but now I focus on that feeling beneath long and measured breaths. It’s on the way to where I’m going: part of the memory, part of the belief modulation exercise.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She kept her hand on the winning piece, and began to rotate it very slowly. Sensations, suddenly, from entirely elsewhere: a low rumble in my cramped lower back, and my nose cold as through pressed to foggy glass. She paused, hooking me with her small eyes, still turning it fractionally: <i>is this okay?</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I nodded.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She continued rotating the piece. There was a lot to see in that moment, in the way the light through the optics danced on her face. I understood that this was where I was to focus. Our eyes locked. And now my spine straightens involuntarily, on this velvet cushion, in this YINS meditation booth.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"My grandfather worked himself to death in an antimony mine,” she began. The words were clearly rehearsed and clearly spoken. “Coughed up one lung and then the other, gone long before I was born. My father agreed with him on exactly one thing, and they fought about all its particulars: his own life would turn out differently. At the end of the millennium he boarded a train to Shanghai with eighty yuan, the highest gaokao score the village had ever seen, and a deathbed blessing. He trained as a civil engineer, built some bridges, and had a family of his own. His hopes for my life were complicated. What I became was even harder to explain.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She was saying the words, and I was saying the words, and now I’m saying the words, low but out loud. We were speaking together, or trading off, or I was repeating them back; it was hard to say. But as she turned that piece, those sensations from elsewhere swam into focus. I was on the floor, but I was also on a coach bus, somewhere mountainous.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"What my father did retain from my grandfather was a fascination with mines, caves, the low places.\" She closed her eyes for a deep breath. “Have you ever been so far below ground that you forgot the shape of the world?\"</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Here and now I repeat that question to myself five times, between slow breaths, as instructed.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“He and his friends were serious spelunkers, and every year they’d visit the Huanglong caves in Hunan. My mother would fret through those nights. But he would always call us the moment he emerged, and he’d come back with disorienting photos, smelling like another planet. And one year he invited me to come along.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I repeat this, too: <i>one year, he invited me to come along.</i> I let myself shiver in the coach’s frigid aircon. I feel just how long I’ve been stuck in this seat, my face against the window, watching steep peaks emerge and retreat in the fog.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I had lived in Shanghai my entire life. I watched them tear down the Mirror Sea, and I watched as it began to re-emerge. It took leaving the city to realize what this had done to my mind. I had felt shadows of it. A bump of panic every time I climbed out of a metro station. But now I was down in this cave, a dozen bends removed from sunlight, and the surface of the world felt distant and abstract. I was weightless between two worlds the moment we turned off our lights.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">At this the lights on the floor between us went dark, and I was down in that cave with her, and I am down in that cave with her. I count out thirty deep breaths, measured out to the calcified drip of water on stone.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Back on the surface, something started to eat at me. I didn't know which of two worlds I had returned to. But I also couldn't say anything what made them different, so I didn't mention it at all. It was only in the evening, on the bus ride back to Changsha, that I realized a familiar pattern of lights was missing from the sky.” The uneasy edge to her voice was honest quadratic delusion, conjured from memory and expertly modulated. “I turned to my dad, pointed up past the tree-line, and asked, <i>Where's Seoul?</i>”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I inhale and feel the surface of our planet go concave. <i>Where’s Seoul? </i>I mutter. There it is, hanging just over Pudong, where I always see its streetlights winking on, duetted with ours, at nightfall. Exhale: the world goes flat, and then convex. And of course there are no cities visible in the sky...that’s where the <i>sky</i> is. Inhale the delusion, and there's Seoul again, of course it is. Exhale, and let it out. I ride this sine wave for almost an hour, mastering the inflow and outflow of quadratic belief, modulating the shape of the world. Acknowledging how readily I can make myself believe almost anything. And then the hard part — coming back down on the right side of things.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You’re going to be just fine, Mona.” The woman from the Weather Bureau said this to me as we parted, raising lights I didn’t know were there. And I repeat that to myself, too, as I open my eyes.</p>\n</section>",

            "content_html": "<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">There is a commotion brewing outside the Dong’an metro station the next day as I’m heading to campus. Redlights and bluelights came to placate the crowd, but of course now they’re bickering with each other: a xiangsheng self-parody of relations between the wards and Blue Delta. The gate attendants look on haplessly from behind reinforced glass.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“They’re fucking with the ping again,” someone finally explains to me, waving their wallet app in my face. “It’s my mother-in-law’s birthday and they’re fucking with the ping.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>They</i> are Suowei, Paracoin, and Chaoyue, the together-issuers of the parallel yuan. In Shanghai we call them the Big Three; up close, their relationship looks like an anvils-and-dynamite rivalry, which half-functions as checks and balances on the ping. But the rest of the world calls them <i>the trident.</i> From a distance they look fearsomely united, wielding Shanghai’s currency as a weapon. They de-pegged it from the Chinese yuan at the crack of dawn with a series of massive trades. Now its value is oscillating wildly. Every last drop of liquidity is in their firehoses. Unlubricated, the network of L2 chains governing ward entry tokens has ground to a halt. The subway gates aren’t letting anyone in or out.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It looks like they’re going after Beijing,” speculates an auntie with a yoga mat under her arm and a fearsome, subscription-quality trader’s dashboard on her rollscroll. “They’re trying to reverse the peg.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The <i>pingxingyuan,</i> the parallel yuan, has its value pegged to the regular yuan. It’s the Chinese economy’s parasitic, high-noon shadow. It slips into all the cracks in forex and treasuries and loans where China’s currency is supposed to go. It’s just a little more liquid, it settles just a little faster, its rates just a little lower. Same great taste, fewer calories: it does Shanghai’s bidding by staying well-behaved. But once in a while the Big Three go on offensive. Their massive trades are made of countless, tiny oscillations: they’ll be watching carefully to see which frequencies they can make the Chinese yuan vibrate at, and amplifying the instruments that carry those waves. The shadow is trying to make its master dance.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Just let us onto the goddamn train,” shouts another one of my neighbors.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eventually they do, and eventually I make it to YINS. The school is in rapture and classes are essentially cancelled. Shanghai’s best and brightest neikonauts are on the battlefield, stinging Beijing with trade after trade from loop-lock. Some students will be watching from a UTMS bed, hoping to glean subtleties of this financial warfare that elude us in soberspace. More of us are watching in darkened lecture halls. I slip into a back row. The boards are tuned to dazzling and incomprehensible visualizations of the trade flow. What I can say for sure is that Shanghai is blue and Beijing is red. But if you squint, and periodically hit your tryptamine pen, you can almost make out what’s happening.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Roundabout mid-afternoon, they pull it off. The e-sports commentators chattering from the sidescreens call it: the peg is reversed, wobbling, but reversed for now. A cheer goes up around me, if not from everyone. Beijing has neikonauts too, but it’s an open secret that they still send their best and brightest to YINS. They meet my gaze, a few of them: surely we all prefer our dogfights on this bloodless and silent new horizon. But there will be fighter pilots, neikonauts themselves, on elevated alert in Suzhou and in Beijing. In Sacramento and Washington they’ll be reading the wind for scraps of what’s happening. The loose joints of SHCA-MASA will flex: Beijing and Washington will find themselves on the same side of this — which, though no serious person in either place would ever admit, is kind of the point.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I’ve been entranced by this welcome distraction. It’s only in the evening that I stop to consider what it all implies. Onscreen I watch reporters hassling traders, panting and toweling off, as they exit the Suowei Tower. Their camballs buzz the upper floors, shot down, raining onto a terrified crowd. “Why today?” A streamer with a press pass shouts at a neikosuited Suowei employee. “What are you using?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It’s proprietary,” he replies, glowering.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Oh, shit.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But it isn’t proprietary, not any more. Late last evening it was posted on a storied neikotics forum, in the legendary <i>Open Eggs</i> thread: a .vxl file of a fairly simple golden orb. Now, this thread is legendary for a reason. Most of the eggs posted there are pranks or worse. Buttholes and cyanide capsules, or their neikotic equivalents, the immer-stuff of the anonymous web. But by now, many of the traders at the Big Three recognized this one. It circulated in secret over weeks past, this lethally precise spectral sieve. It was capable of reducing petabytes of rats-nest trading data to pure, simplified insight. They had a day, maybe, and then Beijing would have it too.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">By sundown the peg is restored. Shanghai is clever, but Beijing is a giant, and they win these battles with torrential, three-gorges outflows of capital. Commentators still consider this a coup for Shanghai: you can do a lot of surgery on an economy with a two-hour causal incursion. China’s will run underclocked for a while, under diagnosis for snares and speed-bumps that Shanghai’s neikonauts have left behind.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“If we just had a Deng Bridge...” I hear one undergrad mutter to another, a Blue Delta pin on his lapel.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">YINS turns its attention to the orb. The fab pumps out copies, and undergrads ponder them in threes and fours in warm-lit student lounges. I wander the halls, watching this play out in stupefied, muffled disbelief. Then the spell breaks. I make for the elevator and rush to the Neikotic Safety clinic. The entire staff seems to be downstairs. Yao is downstairs.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“The Sunflower Sieve,” he tells me, tossing me a copy of the neikotic egg. “That’s what they’re calling it.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I have to feign a little surprise, inspecting the thing. But then again, I hardly caught a flash of it in Tethi’s hand the other night, moments before the commotion at Double Descent. <i>He must have dropped it</i>, I realize. He must be kicking himself. The orb is beautiful. It’s somewhere between transparent and translucent, doing something soft and inviting to light that I’ve never seen before, that I might have thought unphysical. <i>How? How is this possible?</i> The question is the gate to the garden path, and the answer is, precisely, the algorithm that the egg contains.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I consider the golden streaks bursting from the egg’s black and beady core. “It’s a good name.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“No moving parts,” Yao mutters in admiration. He can’t take his eyes off it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Safety floor is preparing for a battle of its own. The clinic’s tryptamine cabinets are restocked, the EASL arrays shined and humming, the scanner beds disinfected. Some of our number are hatching the Sunflower Sieve egg, furtively, on some sure pretense. Dr. Rui is drafting memos about the damage we’ve already seen it do, urging caution, conjuring painful memories of Tenfold Gate. If Suowei and company are using the Sieve this way, their neikonauts surely won’t need to slink up to our clinic for the inversion. But this time tomorrow, everyone at YINS with neikotic channels will have tried it out.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In all of this, I realize, Deng is absent.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Get ready,” Yao mutters gravely, gesturing for the egg back. “They’re coming.”</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">But they don’t.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I camped out in a YINS sleep pod. I treated myself to a long shower and a change of clothes from a bottom drawer. Daybreak brings me back downstairs, to disinfectant-scented anticlimax. I pass the cafeteria on the way: it’s packed with researchers coming down off all-nighters, trays loaded down, conversation low and scattered. But the clinic is emptier than it’s been in weeks. Sure, a few neikonauts have already burned themselves on the Sunflower Sieve. They arrive with ruffled hair and that thousand-yard stare, unable to pin two words together. Lucky them, that we’ve already perfected the inversion.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“What were you using the Sieve for?” we ask, reading from the intake form.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Everything. They were using it for everything. Simplifying proofs and reactor designs. Rifling through the back catalog, straightening out old formulations with clean lines and simple strokes. Later in the morning they arrive from beyond YINS: actuaries and seawall engineers. Political lackeys charged with untangling the net of rivalries and alliances holding the Ward Council together. Some of their work has already borne new, gold-flecked eggs. We have open scanner bays all day, and capacity to spare. Still, every so often comes that piercing <i>zwoop! </i>sound from down the hall. The birth and death of a diving-bell in the blink of an eye. Maybe it hadn’t bothered me much before, but now I have to try hard not to think about it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">With our morning freed up, the Safety floor crowds around monitors to bash refresh on the Soup: the open-access archive for the field of neikotics. It’s flooded with papers announcing applications of the Sunflower Sieve to fluid dynamics and circuit layout and game theory. Some are written by people, but gradually more of them are synthetics. These provide admirable summaries, but the actual synthesis tends to be a little gooey in the middle, and the figures are often nonsensical. We print out and paste up all the silliest ones.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That doesn’t stop anyone from setting up a script to fire thousands of synthetic papers into the Soup, and why should it? Some of the great guidestones of neikotic theory were produced in this rock-tumbler. Waldmann’s Folding Lemma was a synthetic paper, an offhand mathematician’s footnote about choice of sign that bounced blindly and abrasively off all the nonsense in the archive until its contours were clear. The computers are great at sifting these diamonds from the silt, and a synthetic paper that racks up ten thousand or so citations is usually worth at least a glance by a human being.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yao finds me, watches these scroll by for a minute or two, and then asks me whether I have a second.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Sure.” I slam my laptop shut, happy to be useful. “What’s up?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Sit with me in the waiting room.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He picks an inconspicuous spot, behind a curtain of potted jungle plants. The neon tangle of calligraphy on the wall shifts fluidly from <i>water droplets can penetrate a stone</i> to <i>three people make a tiger. </i>I page through a pamphlet. No one’s here.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“What are we doing here, man?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yao clicks his pen, seemingly on edge.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Within ten minutes, though, a student arrives, clutching his head and gritting his teeth. He doesn’t see us back here. I stand to greet him; Yao hisses: “<i>wait.”</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“No one’s at the desk! Who’s front desk right now, anyway?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I am.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Well — what the <i>fuck</i>, Yao?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To his credit he does look ashamed, to be pulling this shit. “Just hang back here. Five minutes. Please.” Then he preoccupies himself with his rollscroll. Our would-be patient has spotted us: he shoots us pained glances through waxy leaves, which make me wonder what he’s feeling. Maybe <i>painful golden light at center of being</i>? It’s very nearly the end of Yao’s allotted five minutes — I’m counting — when the doors slide open and a second neikonaut enters the room. Yao nudges my arm.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“<i>Watch</i>,” he whispers.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The new patient settles in on the other side of the waiting area, facing the first. They ignore each other for a few minutes, but eventually one glances at the other, then at Yao and I lounging in our scrubs. His expression is an quizzical and unmistakable <i>what the fuck</i>, which mirrors my feelings exactly. The other patient looks up and smiles back. They have a rather information-laden and utterly silent exchange. The thrust of which is, why aren’t these assholes checking us in?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Fuck this. I stand halfway up to apologize, and then it hits me, a tilt-shift tidal wave pushing me back into my seat. It appears to me neither in my visual field nor my mind’s eye, but a third space which is cavernous, alien; and yet comforting, familiar. <i>I have a name for this place</i>, I realize. <i>We all do</i>. In it, I see two maze-like, almost cochlear fields of Sunflower Sieve debris. Their bumpy surfaces at close remove, their spiral arms extending and contracting at random. I see their probing roots make contact, and how others whip outward blind-quick to join them. I see a handshake, a protocol, an exchange, a relaxation of enormous coils of tension. All that in just an instant, and then defensive instinct kicks in. I nest blurry matryoshka domes against the vision, stemming the quadratic inrush. <i>I don’t believe it, I don’t...</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Are you seeing this? </i>Yao swipes out a message for me on his rollscroll.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This is a real setback; this is what I sat all last night on that cushion to contain. If you’re getting flashes of the Mirror Sea sober, indoors, you’re probably pretty far gone. And that’s what it was. It was the debris, to be sure, but it was made of stoplights and umbrellas and taxis and mottled, backlit plastic signs that once said PHONE CARDS, all of that and none of it, flashing warm gold and sleek black.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“No,” I insist. I don’t know what Yao is making of these deep, regulated breaths I’m forcing myself to take, but I hope he’s getting the wrong idea.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>One of them is about to leave, </i>he types back.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I shoot to my feet, infuriated, and beeline for the clinicians’ lounge. Yao stands to follow me, and from the corner of my eye I see that, indeed, one of our patients is leaving. I expect the other will follow shortly.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yao shuts the door behind him. All trace of anxiety or embarrassment is gone from his face; he looks utterly vindicated. “Tell me you didn’t see what just happened.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Oh, I saw what happened!” I snap back. Yao and I have never been anything but friendly. This is weird. “I just saw our on-duty clinician silently watch someone suffer in the waiting room until they gave up on getting treatment.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“They don’t <i>need</i> treatment,” he insists. “Mona, everyone who’s coming down to the clinic today has been working in isolation for too long. What they need is a little human contact with someone else carrying the debris and then —”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>And then it uncoils, relaxes, writhes pleasurably for having found more of itself. I saw! I saw!</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I’m going to write you up. I swear I will.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Mona, come look at these scans. Please. I’m not fucking with you.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I have to go. I’m meeting with Deng.” Maybe I let a drop of apology slip in there. <i>I’m sorry, I really am, I just can’t let myself believe this. </i>But also: “Get your shit together.”</p>\n</section>",

            "content_html": "<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">Deng’s making a show of it. As I pull up a cafeteria chair, she slides me a heavy sheet of paper marked up in her own hand, in tight blue ink — even her handwriting has good posture. It’s the same set of nine equations she showed me earlier. Or very nearly so. She smiles.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“The Sunflower Sieve has appeared. It’s time to write the paper on its inversion, or you’ll soon be scooped.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Deng is narrating the world. I know not to interject, even when she takes a long sip of chamomile and bites into a pastry. Of course I’m worried about getting scooped, I insist to myself. Even though any mentions of the Sieve’s danger in the new literature are vague and performative. Even though the part of me that cares about any of that feels scotch-taped together right at this moment. My sense of normalcy is so fragile that every blink and twitch and saccade sends me back to that vision of interlocking debris.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She pats her face with a napkin. “Now, I know you were hoping to work with Dr. Rui, but you might have noticed that he’s taken to spearheading the Safety department’s response to the new egg. He’s become awfully preoccupied with his memos and whatnot.” She sniffs. “So that leaves you with me.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You want to co-author my paper?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Yes. It’s...past time.” She stumbles on that, tapping at the sheet of paper. “And I would like to do it in a particular way. A purely mathematical formulation. A clean sheet.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I read between the lines. I wonder where she might take this if I happen to push back.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You don’t want to mention that I used the Bridge. At all.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I want a work that is as objective and useful as possible.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In early days I clung to hope that Deng and I would submit a paper together. But my ideas were soggy paper-mâché next to an honest-to-god volcano, a force of nature. She didn’t know how to nurture what little I could give her. It never played out quite like this, in those long-curdled fantasies. But here and now, I have something that Deng wants, for whichever of her amorphous reasons. This is the approval I craved. So maybe it’s not high summer sunshine on my face.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Okay,” I hear myself say. “Let’s not mention the prototype.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A whole cloud of unease dissolves pleasantly at this: about the diving-bell and the debris and the Sea. All of that’s just math, isn’t it? Just equations playing out in predictable ways?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Then it hits me again, in a different light, genuinely warm: <i>I’m submitting with Dr. Deng Jinghan!</i> Oh, god, the citations! I try not to salivate, imagining them stack up.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“First author, though, right?” I ask, feeling faintly craven.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She smiles, crosses her legs, and takes another bite. “First author.”</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">And she looks pleased to see me the next day, outside the faculty lounge. Pleased, I realize, to see my hands. She glances down at them, once, twice, with wry approval: “Did you manage it?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I think so.” I give it another moment’s thought. “I think I’ve got it down.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">My hands are covered with ink, because late last night and into the morning I was <i>whiteboarding</i>. I don’t have her mind for math, and I probably never will. And it’s been a long time since I’ve had to do any outside of loop-lock. I cursed Deng, as I factored and combined and plotted her equations, for not just giving me an egg to ponder. But that’s not how she operates. Even if she hadn’t sworn off loop-lock, she’ll always prefer ink on paper in soberspace.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The look she gives me is of a master claiming a novice, and I try not to imagine getting used to it. “Excellent,” she exclaims brightly, and leads me down a hallway. She opens a series of doors with her card. “Mona, this is the fun part. I think you’re really going to like this.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The faculty isn’t hoarding the best scanners for themselves. Not really. They’re <i>breaking them in</i>, they insist between chuckles. <i>Working out the kinks.</i> Still, there’s nowhere on campus outside of the faculty lounge where you can use a late-model Kanwei Pulsar. The last door on the left is for a tiny scanner room, not really big enough for the both of us. It’s dimly lit, the suggestion of sunlight through dense conifers. Ambient music pulses quietly from the walls. And, god, the Pulsar! It has citrus-scented moisture-exchange padding where the clinic’s beds have sweat-stained foam. It has chrome-plated controls on the armrests. It has fucking teak accents, man, I dunno.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Deng watches my reaction with contained delight. “Kanwei claims they’ve nailed prose with the Pulsar. If you’re going to be writing, you should try it.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Prose doesn’t mix so well with loop-lock. Writing in this way amounts to tiling in with a vague intention and letting the scanner rapidly probe your mind with a language model. It’s remarkably fast and eerily passive. Personally I doubt that Kanwei has <i>nailed</i> prose, but the Pulsar could hardly produce worse results than the first couple of papers I handed in written on student-center Gliders, five or six years old even back then.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It might take a few tries, but I’m told it’s very fast. I’ll be waiting outside.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So I close the door to the booth. A stillness descends, punctuated by the scanner’s clicks and beeps. I <i>do</i> know how to write this paper, I realize, looking at my blue-stained hands. Most of it will be the model’s doing, the guardrails of academic prose. But I can supply the rest. I have a mathematician’s sense, imperfect but immediate, of how my inversion works.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Even the visor smells nice. I paw at the shiny knobs, dialing in my settings, and then the Kanwei logo hovers in front of my eyes. <i>STAND BY FOR TILES.</i> The magnetized whine of the scanner encroaches and overtakes…</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And I understand the Sunflower Sieve debris better, too. I understand it with textbook words like <i>pathological subdomain</i> and <i>measure-zero Kakei expansions.</i> It spills and twinkles from the negative space of Deng’s equations. I won’t think about that.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The nearly ultrasonic whine takes on even higher, tangy, citrus harmonics as an absolute wall of tangerine assails my eyes. The tryptamine hits: I feel a wave of intricate bliss, a vivid image of Deng smiling knowingly — the trip almost gets away from me before I can focus on the color, willing it to burst into four, and then again and again, primer tiles looping more than a hundred times a second, until I'm right on the verge of it. The sync is<i> crisp</i>, the colors bursting with skylike luminescence, the computer firmly but smoothly under my control, and I under its. The building blocks of my reality in loop-lock with the Pulsar are like a gemstone dust, almost fine enough to let real emotions swirl misty around me.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>I could get used to this,</i> I think. And then I’m back. There was the flashing, oscillating sensation of the language model scrubbing my channels. A blinding, rainbow-road prismatism. Now, just the sound of blood in my ears. Barely thirty seconds have passed, so little time that the DMT has only just peaked. I let the trip fade, birdsong made of bells made of birdsong, and then rise from the scanner to see just what it is that I’ve written.</p>\n\n<p class=\"p3 mono centered\"><b>A Generalized Inversion for Sunflower Sieve Debris</b><br>\nXu Maoli (xu.mona@yins.edu); Deng Jinghan (deng@yins.edu)</p>\n\n<p class=\"p1\">So far so good.

The gap between here and there is going to feel like no space at all. Last time, with Cai by my side, I loved this feeling, loved it all too much.

For a brief moment it seems like she’s going to give me a hug.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“This is <i>exciting</i>,” she’s muttering to herself an hour or so later, hands flying at the lab server’s keyboard. Deng is corresponding author, which means that it’s her job to fill out the various declarations and disclaimers of the Soup’s submission process. My job is to pace uncertainly around her office, swigging from a water bottle. I watch her compose a two-paragraph abstract without hitting the backspace key once.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Jesus Christ,” I exclaim, looking over her shoulder.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I’ve written a lot of these, you know, in my time.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“No, I mean — your inbox. Do you ever clear that out?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Deng has “99+”<i> </i>unread messages on the Soup. She smirks, clicks and scrolls lazily through them. “When you’re one of the…” she begins, and stops when she can’t find a self-effacing way to finish the thought. “I mean to say, a person in my position attracts a lot of crackpots with their crackpot theories. It’s not really a good way to get ahold of me.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Later on, she lets me click the button. Submitting to the Soup is a pretty visual affair; I watch my paper drop into the citation graph, losing track of that single star in a spiderwebbed milky-way. Within a minute, there’s a flash of activity as the synthesizers get ahold of it and deem it worthy, tying <i>A Generalized Inversion for Sunflower Sieve debris</i> in silken strands to the rest of the field. No doubt Deng Jinghan’s name has a lot to do with that. A relieved exhale, almost a sob, as the citation count ticks into the hundreds, and my work is woven into the story of the Sunflower Sieve. <i>I’m published. I finally did it.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Behind Deng’s big stack of tea boxes she’s apparently been stashing several pricey blue bottles of Yanghe. She twists one open with some difficulty and sloshes some into her teacups, and then we drink, laughing and coughing as the baijiu stings our throats. It feels like there’s nothing left to say. I sigh contentedly and cast lazy glances around her office, which is half-illuminated by a stolen salt lamp. There’s a gunmetal-grey piece of a Navy loop-lock rig. A wall of degrees and certificates and commendations. Only one photograph: Deng’s mother, who died the year we moved here.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Maybe there is more to say here, between us. Maybe the drinking accelerates just a little as we both try to figure out what it is. After my third cup I pick up the hard copy of the paper, put it down, and then after some hesitation pick it up again. “Is this <i>useful?</i>” I ask, breaking another silence. “I mean, I get that it describes the inversion accurately. But is it enough to reconstruct it?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Is it enough to reconstruct it…” Deng mutters to herself. “No. It’s not. For a motivated reader, it would be a good leg up. For someone else it might be the starting point for a new inversion entirely. That’s the beauty of math, isn’t it? You cast an idea in a shared language, and then it’s the world’s to interpret.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She looks pleased with this thought, but I must look crestfallen.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Oh, Mona, don’t —“</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I want to be able to do what you do.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She shifts in her chair, leans forward, and eventually puts a tentative hand on my shoulder. “Please don’t get it wrong,” she offers, after a while. “What I do — on paper with symbols — maybe it’s happening too slowly to see just yet, but that’s a dying art. You <i>did</i> do this, in loop-lock, because you’re a neikonaut. <i>Math is what happens in the moment.</i> I knew someone who always liked to say that.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Deng knew Adrianna Lam.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I’m worried about Yao.” I blurt it out, and hope that Deng will see this as a non sequitur. “Yao Tongduan, the undergrad. He’s…got some ideas about the Sunflower Sieve debris. He seems to think that it’s computing something in…” it’s hard to separate what he said from what I saw. “In…I dunno, the space between our minds? Does that make any sense?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“In the Mirror Sea,” Deng concludes.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I…” My face goes cold. “<i>I </i>didn’t say that.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Oh, for heaven’s sake, Mona, it’s okay! Don’t give me that dreadful look. I suppose you’ll be shocked to hear this, but I look at the Mirror Sea too. I struggle, sometimes, with what I see in it. And I know, in the limit, that what happens on those screens and what happens in our minds, well…” At loss for words, she slowly and portentously enmeshes the fingers of both hands. I nod.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Deng was off at a conference, a year ago in spring, when my Ripple crashed and I snapped and the Weather Bureau brought me in. I had moved to Xietu South by the time she returned. This, now — this is us talking about it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“In that case, I have something you should see.” Then, quickly: “I mean, that Yao should see.” She’s at her keyboard again, digging through directories. She pulls up a video with a timestamp nearly two decades past. She fast-forwards through most of it. And, wow — that’s her on camera, wearing a chunky necklace in saturated primary colors. And now there’s Dr. Rui in a threadbare Fudan University crew neck, with a full head of hair. In their accelerated bustle, they’re wiring up two test subjects with primitive electrodes.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“An empathetic baseline was established between two subjects.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The readouts from the electrodes appear: low-res neikotic manifolds, barely clear enough to see anything. The lights go out, but there’s a candle on the table between N.001 LI WENHAI (he’s saying something) and N.014 QIU MIN (she’s smiling, and now she’s responding). Gradually, painstakingly, some correlations appear in their ‘folds. There’s something else in there, too.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Debris,” I mutter.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Soberware,” Deng corrects, a little warily. “Or at least debris constructed with a certain amount of intention. Which was, in this experiment, to transmit just a handful of bytes from one skilled neikonaut to the other.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I find I’m biting down on my tongue, and I don’t know why. “You mean, like, telepathically?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Well, it sounds rather stupid when you put it like that, doesn’t it?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She lets the video play at true speed, silent and dim and nearly greyscale, for a minute or so. The hoped-for transference doesn’t materialize and, after a while, the correlations in their manifolds disappear. The video is affecting Deng more than she realizes. I can see her getting lost in faces that, quite likely, she hasn’t seen in a long time. When it ends, though, she closes it briskly and blinks that all away. “It’s not possible, Mona. We wasted too many months believing that it was — and we did believe, we really did.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“So you’d never consider running it again?” This sloshes out of me before I can consider it. “I mean, with modern hardware, surely, there’s a possibility that you’d pick up a signal you missed last time?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“No,” she says, quite firmly. “Thankfully this was never declassified. Now, let’s just say, I prefer this to be an embarrassing little secret for Rui and I. It’s…good…though, that you brought this up about Yao Tongduan…” Right. Yao. “Perhaps it’ll help him to see this.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It’s time to call it a night. I toss back the last of my baijiu and Deng really does hug me now, squeezing me loosely with her arms and tightly with her hands.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Talk to your patients, before you draw conclusions.” She says this to me just before the door clicks, her feet up on the desk. She sounds a little drunk. “You and Yao. That’s what good clinicians do.”</p>\n</section>",

            "content_html": "<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sunflower mania grips Shanghai.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Consider my downstairs neighbor, a man with red cheeks and a shock of white hair who we call Lao Miao. A retired mechanic, the man to beat at chess in our little combover of a park, a big hit with the aunties. Miao considers himself a citizen of Xietu South Ward, and then of the People’s Republic of China, and nothing in between. He keeps his long-expired Chinese shenfenzheng card taped to the back of an old cell phone, the chip from his YZID reluctantly stuffed inside. He gambles in RMB, wins in parallel yuan, and goes down the street to exchange it right back. He gripes about Blue Delta’s overreaction to the Xia Zitian thing. Now <i>there</i> was a man, he once mused to no one in particular, who made a single mistake! And admitted it!</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For Lao Miao, Shanghai’s estrangement from Beijing is a sad, slow-motion mistake orchestrated by the masochists at Blue Delta and the maniacs at the Big Three. It’s not something normal people want. And it does take a certain lanyard-induced hypoxia to muster pride for the Yangtze Delta Orthogonal Zone, and its strange new exports: parallel, counterfactual, virtual, neikotic. But every so often Shanghai produces something only it knows how to produce, that the rest of the world actually needs. On such a day there’s a sense of being here and not there, now and not then, in the eye contact on the subway and the downbeat of the chatter with the danbing guy. On such a day even Lao Miao might be cajoled into wearing a little sunflower on his lapel.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Good morning, Mona,” he calls as I step outside. I wouldn’t have guessed he knows my name, but he positively sings it (high-high) in that reedy voice of his, classic and fine-tuned like one of his mopeds.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The ads on the metro, for skin cream and yogurt and daycare, have all been convolved to bloom with sunflowers. The Malay women in the interchanges are selling the things by the dozen, newly dead or freshly printed. A subtitled YZTV broadcast features a Blue Delta rep, flanked by glowering Ward Council delegates. Impossibly, they all agree that the Sieve will succeed where countless strategies and programs have failed, lighting the way to reunify the wards.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Camball footage now: reporters outside Xia Zitian’s dingzifang compound, rabid for his take. He emerges in a bathrobe, adjusts his ankle monitor, and shoos them away with a slipper.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Nobody mentions the debris.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The whole city is converging on Beiwan, tour groups and school buses on pilgrimage to YINS. The one little ice cream shop is drowning in business. Sunflowers <i>everywhere</i>: on hats and glo-wands and streamers. I really can’t help but notice that our barren little Mirror Sea is dense with Ripples today, and that it’s flecked and stranded with goldenrod. I keep my eyes away.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Deng’s experiment wouldn’t be so hard anymore. With a willing partner I could run it in an afternoon. I’d need a pair of readonly electrode nets, easy to borrow from the library. And to establish an empathetic baseline, these days —</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Do you have an intersubjectivity optics kit?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The librarian nods, and fetches a velvet bag clattering with heavy lights and mirrors and prisms.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Downstairs, I search for Yao. Maybe I’m not ready to drag him into this yet, but I consider how I’d couch it to him. If it doesn’t work, that’ll be good for both of us. If it <i>does </i>work, well. His desk is unoccupied, and empty aside from his copy of the Sunflower Sieve egg. I consider leaving a note. Instead I find myself handling the orb, weighing it in my palm. <i>Really, you shouldn’t.</i> But of course I need to, sooner or later. This thing is going to be part of every neikonaut’s toolkit within weeks. Besides, if I’m going to help Yao out of his delusions, I need to see what he sees.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">I hatch the Sieve. It’s bizarre and otherworldly, sure, but really it’s straightforward as neikotic eggs go. Its amber mantle softens and bends light with a fibrous nest of tubules in the core, and their basic structure is the shadow of something more profound that I know will unfold in loop-lock. Tethi gave his customers thirty minutes to learn the thing in the darkness of Double Descent. Were there any real light down there, they could have done it in ten.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I return the egg to Yao’s desk, and I bring the Sieve into loop-lock. With each eye two inches from a screen, I force myself to hallucinate its secret patterns in the again-again staticky tile-shapes. In loop-lock, <span class=\"s1\">I don’t feel anything immediately.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Then the Sieve unfolds like an optical illusion. I notice that certain shapes I thought far in the distance are actually alarmingly close, and when I focus on moving them (for of course they are my own thoughts) I see how they articulate. I peel the machinery into the foreground, willing it to flex and bend, watching carefully how its pieces interact with each other, shocked at the size of the thing. Soon the ways it moves become apparent, its stiffnesses and affordances more familiar than the body reclining in the scanner chair.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">If I had to describe it, and I guess I do, I would say I feel like a translucent, semirigid nest of millions of tubes ranging from the carotid to the capillary, like a pipe organ from the distant future. The bulk of my attention is not so much fixed on the Sieve as <i>is</i> the Sieve; but there’s enough of myself left over to admire it from all kinds of angles.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Then I look for some shit to put in it.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">The thing about the Weather Bureau is that they really do still report the weather. From their servers I braid feeds from millions of sensors — temperature, pressure, humidity, wind, sunlight — from Chongming to Suzhou. This is the rawest data I can find, terabytes free of context or cleaning, and I spool it into the Sieve until I think I might burst. And as the Sieve churns, some of its pipes do burst. They go — ahem — <i>thoing!<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></i> Overloaded arteries spill half-digested data into tilespace.<i> Thoing! Thoing! Thoing!</i> More than half of the tubules snap and wither. Ninety percent. Ninety-nine. In ingesting a year of weather readings, the Sieve has become a sparse yet highly predictive little snowglobe that says exactly when it’s going to rain. It sings with probability amplitudes tinged with petrichor.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">It’s so good that you could easily ignore the neikotic debris spilling out of it by the megabyte.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">I leave the Sieve behind, paging it to disk, and follow the debris as it sinks into the lower eta band. The loops are slower down here, the tiles darker. The debris is hard to spot: flaky distortions in tilespace, thousands of tiny jitters. I descend. <i>Focus. Oversample a single piece.</i> It’s barely ten tiles wide, quantized and comb-like, flitting rapidly. It collides with another piece. And another. Their eerily primitive snowflake-arms and cilia and corkscrews dazzle me with all the ways they fit together. The clumps become complex chunks of tile, reaching and darting with a microbial quickness. But as they reach a certain size, they converge towards that familiar coiling, meshing alphabet of shapes. Only now ten times larger...</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">I watch, astounded, as the golden flakes of the Sieve’s debris reassemble themselves, sticky and motile and almost velcro-like, into the same patterns at ever larger orders of magnitude. A single enormous piece emerges in the flurry. I dash and slosh around it, chasing good angles, watching the corkscrew-nautilus grab for another piece at its own giant scale. It scintillates frustratedly in place, too fast for the garbage collector to have a chance, heavy enough to hurt.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">And it’s...reflective. Its outer layer flashes with the eta-band’s murky blue. </span>It occurs to me that in loop-lock, things don't just reflect light. The reflection has to be computed, ray-traced. It takes tiles, cycles, time and energy to do this. <i>Why bother?</i> I draw closer, expanding its surface across my awareness, trying to untangle the pattern...</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Suddenly, there’s a faint and discordant rumbling from even deeper in my tilespace. <i>You’ve really done it now, Mona.</i> With a flick of intention I collapse the Sieve and even more debris comes snowing down. I cast around, I realize, for a defensive weapon. I fashion myself into something wily and sharp. The rumbling grows into something orange and un-ignorable, into a buzzing. That’s when I realize, feeling faintly stupid, that someone is ringing the scanner booth’s doorbell. Poking the beehive.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">“Yes?” I grumble, two minutes later. One of the Safety department’s undergrad researchers is at the door. She looks nervous — God, is this how they see me?</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">She explains. Which is to say that her mouth is moving, but just what I get from this is glimmering chatter, half-information, total nonsense. It enters through my ears but then seems to veer away from the language center of my brain.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">“I’m sorry, <i>what?</i>”</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">She repeats herself slowly, those same mouth movements. I realize — and I don’t know how else to explain this — that I’ve been focusing in the wrong place entirely. There’s that sudden, tilt-shift effect again, and language snaps into focus. I arrive in time to catch the words<i> conference room</i> and <i>emergency meeting</i>. I don’t think I’ve blinked once.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">She gives me a weird look. “Are you coming?”</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">“Yeah. Sorry.” I mess with my hair tie, and wipe sweat off my face. “Lead the way.”</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">The Sieve debris hurts like hell, for a minute. All those symptoms from the checklist — facial tics, golden light — those are real to me now. A micro-pixelated marimba-fountain with the metallic aftertaste of encryption burbles in my gut, and I worry that if I open my mouth again, something incomprehensible and yet legibly horrifying will come out.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Then I catch the eye of a neikonaut in the hall. I feel it, primarily, in my teeth: a millisecond of intricate tumbler-clicking. Emotionally I parse his look, the half-smile, as <i>you too, huh?</i> And then there’s a release of pressure, a reconfiguration, an expansion. My Sunflower Sieve debris interlocks with his and levels out, and suddenly it’s no more than ankle-deep. <i>Wait! </i>I want to shout at him, my language center back in the foreground. <i>What just happened?</i> But the moment is already long gone. I don’t think he noticed anything at all.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">“What did you say this meeting was about?” I ask, sure that I’ve already been given the answer twice.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">But she doesn’t seem to really know. “Something...I dunno, about the Sieve. They’re waiting for you.”</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">We turn a corner, and then another, and she lets me pry open the door.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">“<i>Surprise,</i>” shouts the entire Neikotic Safety department. Someone blows on a noisemaker.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">The name of the game is Mona Is The Big Hero. There’s a banner over the whiteboard that says this, more or less. There are streamers (YINS-colored), some kind of sunflower cakes (store-bought), and summerpop playing on Dr. Ku’s bluetooth speaker. I note with discomfort that some of the balloons have been printed in the shape of the diving-bell. I don’t like that anyone’s examined it so closely.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Oh, good, you’re here.” Deng greets me briskly, as though this really were an emergency meeting. “I sent Yao to fetch you half an hour ago. Have you seen him?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">My fingers trace lines in my forehead. It’s awfully bright in here. “Not at all.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She puckers her face disapprovingly. “Well. Have a cake!”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The room is lousy with Sieve debris. There’s a noisy, feverish tingling at the edge of everything. It’s just a little extra something — a filmy lens that bobs in and out of my awareness, showing me the words behind the words, the colors behind the colors. If it wasn’t so terrifying, it would be sort of funny, clocking which of the department’s biggest Sieve whistleblowers are using the algorithm themselves. As it stands, I feel it sloshing and between us, filling up the space between the pleasantries and the paper-cup toasts. The Sieve seems to want to gently copilot my words — and for a while, I let it, tuning out my own mouth-sounds and wondering, <i>is anyone else seeing this?</i> And also, <i>where’s Yao?</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dr. Qin stands up and gives a nicely parceled speech about how my inversion is going to make the Sunflower Sieve safe to use, for now. “This is only the first step,” he concedes. “YINS must redouble its efforts to derive a version that produces no debris.” He nods graciously to Deng, who has been looking awfully flustered. The secret behind my paper is no secret, really — people keep muttering about <i>the Bridge</i>, <i>the Deng Bridge</i>, and she roves around white-knuckling a plastic fork like a prison shiv. She and Rui are doing this binary-star thing where they’re on opposite sides of the room at all times.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The real, unpleasant surprise is that someone from the YINS press office is here to profile me.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Tell me about your childhood,” she says, over the whir of the camball.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So I tell her about cable cars and a flock of stray parrots. Dim sum on Sundays with men in vests and women in blazers, my parents and their friends always talking about<i> building</i> this or that, me staring out the half-fogged window wondering where it could possibly be. Geriatric beach-fossil San Francisco given six months a hundred times, her sweets and stories for me, the sickness glimpsed early through car windows between soccer and robotics. Tents. Fire. Asthma.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“We need a few hundred seconds of facial movement,” she says when I pause for breath, peeking up from her tablet. “Just keep talking.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">My first acid trip too early, the whole city hanging by the thread of the Bay Bridge. The long running joke about how California should go it alone. The conspiracy, from left and right, from within and without, that made it real. The President calling it a Mexican colony, a Chinese colony, old snarls on new lips, the last few rungs of that awful ladder rusting and snapping off. A mayor walks into a drone tipped with carfentanyl, and no one in her office carries narcan. Smoke. Tremors. Waves.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"Tell me about Stanford?\"</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Men in uncertain uniform watching who gets off at Palo Alto station. Ha, not redlights, but you get the idea. Hills of quiet flax, my world shrinking. My parents in deep Marin with solar panels and a sheepdog and a gun, more train rides in the other direction. Los Angeles, vibrant and present with its own decay and regeneration. Ayahuasca work with fortunate sons and poverty's daughters. The fog I was born in lifted briefly from my mind, a repressed urge to engage rather than observe, wondering if I should change majors, change schools, on the return trip north. Right, Stanford...</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"When you met Dr. Deng, did you realize who she <i>was</i> at the time?\"</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Another bad semester, another summer break with a near-stranger in Venice Beach. In October, an oddly formal email to the <i>plant-medicines</i> mailing list. A ten-minute conversation in Deng's pompous English and my underbaked Mandarin, a half-finished machine and her inside it with a soldering iron. A stack of papers in Chinese filled with words my translator app didn’t even know yet, laying out the field of neikotics. And suddenly, a reason to stay enrolled and keep my GPA above water: I was a barnacle on this group building something called a UTMS scanner, one of the first of its kind Stateside. When it was done, I would sit inside and — in a way that I could hardly imagine<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>— speak directly to a computer in its own language.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And no. I didn't realize who she was at the time.</p>\n</section>",

            "content_html": "<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">What happens to me next?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Your guess is nearly as good as mine. I found my way out of my own surprise party sometime before it died down. I found myself out on the street, doing what it took minute-by-minute effort to avoid this morning: looking at the displays. There’s something in there, all right. The goldenrod rays in the Sea — which, surely, must be caused by all that sunflower memorabilia — they’re always far in the background, extending in streaks that want to be straight, but can’t quite manage. They shine like crayon scrawl made of nighttime skylines, and they intersect at distant, twinkling nodal points. A structure is forming in there. No single display could show the smallest fraction of it. But I’m carrying around mental machinery that makes it impossible to miss: I draw connections, fill gaps, extrapolate.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I haven’t felt this way, not really, since those last few good nights with Cai. But the logic that we saw in the Sea back then was gooey and silty. It explained the quiet and ephemeral things, the fine texture of the world. This is different. The thing emerging in the Sea is rigid and discrete. Its structure mirrors the ward network’s: it almost seems to play it forward in stuttering half-steps. It echoes what little I understand of Shanghai’s network of L2 chains that control the parallel yuan and the court of minor currencies it keeps. The metro system, the traffic cycles, it’s all in there, it’s all far more interconnected, and yet far simpler, than we ever imagined. You just have to see these sunflower-yellow nodes and edges, you really do, glinting unseen but not quite, mapping hidden causalities...</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Late afternoon in Hongkou East I see a man drop to his knees and put his hands behind his back, eyes averted from a particularly vibrant Mirror Sea display wrapped around a bank branch. Within minutes, faster than you’d expect, there are Weather Bureau agents storming out of a veetle with their visors and synthvox to sedate him. You can call 1-1-4 to sic the Bureau on yourself, see. That way they’ll go easy on you. I wanted to see if he’s a neikonaut, to ask if he’s seeing what I’m seeing. But it could so easily be something else entirely — the Sea is wide and deep enough to hold dozens, even hundreds of jostling delusions.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Night falls in what feels like a blink. I’m back in Beiwan, regaining a grip. All my stuff is still here at YINS. And the Safety floor is quiet, half-dark. I stride towards my desk, hoping to see no one.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“<i>Mo</i>-na,” someone whispers behind me.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I almost throw my back out, wheeling around that way. “<i>Fucking</i> hell, Yao!”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Mona.” He peeks out of a frosted conference room, gesturing for me. “C’mere. You’re really going to like this.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I’m not so sure about that. I smell hot glue in there.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I step inside and see about three hundred pieces of printed Sunflower Sieve debris on the table. He’s been assembling it. It’s — oh, Jesus, it really looks different now. All the same colors and surface textures, only far less gnarled and coiled. These new shards, they offer extended, jointed notchways. There’s no way Yao could have started with a plan; most likely he just found two matching surfaces and started gluing, until he ended up with this hollow network of scraggly spindles, a triangle-mesh self-scaffold, the endoskeleton of something ravenous and rotund, armspan-wide and growing. I have the uneasy sense it could expand forever in any direction.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I saw it out there,” he explains. There’s a deeply quadratic twang to his voice, and I can’t make myself look him in the eye. “But it’s not the same structure, exactly. It’s not the mirror image, either. It’s the <i>dual</i> —”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Out...where?” I ask. Not altogether sure why I’m playing it dumb, except that Yao’s presence in this room feels like a whirlpool. Instinct tells me to struggle away with all possible might, lest I get sucked into some dark vortex, some final calm.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Oh, <i>come on</i>.” This is not his usual tone of voice, so languid and heavy-lidded. “I don’t mean to be weird about it, but we all know what happened to you last year. It’s okay though!” His usual brightness peeks through, pitched just too high. “I look at it too. Sometimes I’ll have a tough p-set, and I go and take a long walk, and the answers just <i>come </i>to me.” He angles around to meet my eyes, and smiles through me. “I can tell you’re using it too. It’s <i>okay</i>.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Our debris clicks and chatters and interlocks, and I can tell he’s manipulating it in a way that I don’t understand, that I don’t want to understand. It feels like losing that game at the Weather Bureau, only the light is warm and gold instead of cold and white. Something tightens and flexes inside me, far too quickly. I want to be sick.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Yao, you need to take the inversion.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“That makes two of us.” He laughs like I’m in on the joke.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I’m serious, dude. I’m gonna go warm up a scanner.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“No<i>.</i>” He grasps my arms. “<i>I’m </i>serious. You can’t. While I was out there...I...it was the most wonderful coincidences, everywhere. Couples. Dogs. Buses.” There are whole stories brewing behind each of these words, which is why it takes him so long to force them out. “It’s all falling into place out there. And I’m <i>causing</i> it, Mona. I can keep doing this for people...”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You better come with me or I’m going to call in a four-oh-eight.” Dangerously uncooperative patient.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Please — no.” His mouth moves in fishy little o’s. “<i>Please</i>, would you please just go in there with the Bridge? There are some little snags in there, some, some, some little bits I know aren’t working right. If you get those, I can do the whole city.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The four-oh-eight is both faster and more violent than I expected. I take two steps back and flex my wrist in a particular way until my wanji buzzes three times. I imagine some unfortunate grad student grumbling out of bed and pulling on pants — but within a minute Deng, Rui, and two others burst out from behind closed doors. Yao sees what’s happening and panics too late; I mouth <i>sorry</i> as we restrain him by the wrists.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Mona, are you totally sure?” Deng asks, hovering over Yao with a sedative. He’s wiggling to get an arm free, and then he does, and then he clips her in the nose with a flailing hand.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Rui looks white in the face as they pin him back onto the table. “God’s sake, Jinghan, just do it!”</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">We take him to Medical on the upper floors, trying to prop him up and then resorting to a stretcher. The autovial of sedative, a squishy and translucent blue thing, adheres firmly to his limp forearm. YINS’ real medics are largely not neikonauts, and thank the depths for that, because I can’t interact with anyone else carrying Sieve debris right now. They receive us with the generally unsurprised demeanor of <i>this again, huh.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I showed him the video,” Deng informs me, nasally, as we stand over his hospital bed. She’s holding a cotton ball to her nose. “I thought that would help.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A nurse knocks on the half-ajar door, holding a big fucking syringe. “It’s either this,” he explains, “or you can hotwire him when he comes to.” He begins clipping up Yao with all sorts of things, I imagine, to make him feel stupid when he wakes up.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We sit with Yao for an appropriate span, and I try not to notice the look that Rui is giving Deng, or the way she’s avoiding it. I don’t react much when they both rise to go. Instead I wait one minute, two, and follow them. They’re talking, animated and unhappy, in a little nook down the hall. I can’t make out what they’re saying — that is, until I take some quiet paces forward, and duck behind a large cart of linens. I begin the long process of untying and re-tying my shoe.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“...should’ve taken a page out of Peter’s book,” Deng is whispering, low and insistent. “I should have taken a sledgehammer to that thing the moment I arrived.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It’s university property.” Rui is not speaking quite so quietly, but he casts glances around. “She’s an enormously skilled neikonaut, and she has every right to be using it.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I <i>know</i> she’s a skilled neikonaut, Rui. That’s why I brought her to Shanghai.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Oh, I hate when she says that. You didn’t <i>bring</i> me anywhere, old woman.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“This is all beside the point.” Dr. Rui sighs, low and frustrated, like he’s struggling to open a jar. “All the faculty are ready to proceed except you. We can do it a few different ways...”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It’s not beside the point...”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“We can make the inversion mandatory. At least at YINS. Or — and this is what I’d prefer — we can bake it into the loop-lock virtual machine. Build it into the tile-out process. Isn’t that your entire godforsaken <i>thing</i>, Deng?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It’s her!” Deng erupts. “The inversion is <i>her</i>, more of her than anyone should be comfortable with. Fifty thousand neikonauts in this city. Call it two hundred loop-lock sessions a year. That’s ten million times it’s run!” They pause while the doctor shuffles awkwardly by, and Deng catches her breath. “I’m deriving a clean version from scratch. Her paper gets us most of the way there. I need a week. Maybe two.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“The last thing — the very last thing — that we want to do is cause a panic. And the longer we wait...”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Their voices fade around a corner. I stride to follow them, hear nothing, then round the bend ever so casually. I catch Rui closing a balcony door. Blood thumping, I find a circular pillar to crouch behind and press myself against the exterior window, peeking out through a sunshade. The two are bathed in dim multicolored light from the library windows above, the wind whipping Deng’s hair. Rui gestures wildly: at her, himself, the school, the distant skyline. Deng keeps her arms folded, still gripping a bloody tissue.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Rui pulls a manila envelope from his jacket, seems to weigh it for a moment, and hands it to Deng.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She gives him a foul look, tearing it open. She finds something soft and circular inside. Deng examines it for a second and then positively snarls, raising the object and using it to smack Rui back and forth across the face. Then she tries to rip it in half, gives up, and leaves it in a trash can. She storms inside. The door swings in her wake.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">After Rui spends a dejected moment scrolling his wanji, after he sighs and wanders away, I creep back down the hall and onto the balcony. I scrunch my nose, fishing through orange peels and surgical masks until I find whatever it is that made Deng angry. No, furious, in a way that even I have never seen. It’s a machine-stitched patch, a round and innocuous iron-on thing that you’d expect to see on a fighter pilot’s flight suit.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It depicts a flower, in full yellow bloom around the edges and beady-black in the center.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Four characters crest the bottom edge: <i>kui hua yi hao.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sunflower-I. <i>Sunflower One.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">On my way out, I stop by the Mirror Sea display in the lobby, pondering the faint golden streaks in the background. Someone passes, a neikonaut, and gives me a concerned look. I want to shake her and shout: <i>how are you not seeing this?</i> Instead, I keep my eyes fixed on the pixels. Willing, no, daring the diving-bell to appear.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>If you’re really in there </i>— I find the thought low in my throat, soft on my tongue — <i>I’m sorry</i>.</p>\n</section>",

I run my fingers over it as though its stitched ridges might offer some essential clue. The sunflower it depicts is in full, stylized bloom. Spirals of seeds decorate the center. It all suggests some military or spacefaring origin, and I find myself searching the web for the phrase:<i> sunflower-I. sunflower program deng jinghan.</i> There are literally one million results on the Soup, of course, and the only way to filter out the Sieve-related stuff is to sort oldest-first. There was a strongwave detector called Sunflower on a Jupiter mission a few years back. There’s a symmetry group that mathematicians have given the same name…</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I plug in <i>sunflower fudan university</i>. Nothing.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>sunflower deng jinghan</i> is a mess. There are papers claiming to have co-authored the Sunflower Sieve with Deng Jinghan four whole years ago. This stops my heart for a second, until I peek at the timestamps: they’re from more like four hours ago. The Soup is rife with malicious actors, and confidence in anything comes only with consensus, with very large numbers.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Reluctantly I type in plain old <i>Deng Jinghan. </i>My finger hovers over the Enter key like a gavel.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She ranks as the #9 all-time most cited author on the Soup. Her affiliation and ORCID and bokeh-framed YINS headshot come with a big fat green checkmark. I flip through her old work. I’ve seen all this before; back at Stanford I devoured it in weeks. I sort back-to-front, scrolling past hundreds of papers until I arrive at her latest, my first: <i>A Generalized Inversion for Sunflower Sieve Debris.</i> There are already 58 comments, most “hidden by author” for thickening the Soup with more bold-faced lies.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">One claims that Deng stole the inversion from a small neikotics firm downtown. It offers leniency if she agrees to settle quickly and privately.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Another advertises a chakra-clearing technique inspired by Dr. Deng Jinghan’s work. (I bookmark this for later.)</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A third offers free, high-quality neikotic pleasure protocols. Click here!</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A fourth has a green checkmark next to the name.</p>\n\n<p class=\"p3 mail\"><b>Dr. Zhang Peifeng<br>\n</b><i>Applied Neikotics - Fudan University<br>\n</i>22 minutes ago<br>\n<br>\nI lament that you continue to ignore my messages and comments. There is something I need to show you related to the Sunflower Sieve. I urge you to check your inbox with all possible haste.</p>\n\n<p class=\"p1\">It’s easy enough to verify from Fudan’s website that Dr. Zhang Peifeng is a real guy, and that it’s really his public key on the Soup. A minor figure, sure, but a minor figure with tenure — and for days he’s been leaving comments all over Deng’s body of work, his wild-eyed urgency cresting over the course of the week. <i>I urge you to check your inbox with all possible haste. </i>My head spins with curiosity and preemptive guilt as I open a tunnel to the lab server.</p>\n\n<p class=\"p3 mono\">$ nmcli con up id yins-vpn<br>\n$ vsc denglab.safety.yins.edu -p 4238<br>\n<br>\nusername: root@denglab<br>\npassword: ***********************</p>\n\n<p class=\"p1\">This is not just low, Mona, it’s <i>dumb. </i>Why would she log onto the Soup on the lab machine? Okay, I had watched her do it, as we submitted our paper. But it would be stupid, really, for her to stay logged into the Soup on the lab machine. There’s no way she’s logged into the — oh, for fuck’s sake, it’s <i>bookmarked.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She’s logged into the Soup on the lab machine.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Oh, really, I mustn’t.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I force a few deep breaths. I clutch the sunflower patch: somehow I’ve gotten it through my head that it’s very old, something about the font and the stitching, but it might easily have been printed yesterday. I’m not going to do it. I’m not going to do it. I’m going to close the —</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Click.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The first message from Dr. Zhang Peifeng reads as follows:</p>\n\n<p class=\"p3 mail\">Dr. Deng,<br>\n<br>\nI hope this finds you well. I offer heartfelt apologies for both the long lapse in correspondence between us, and thus for the intrusiveness of this message.<br>\n<br>\nI just read your latest, <i>A Generalized Inversion For Sunflower Sieve Debris</i>. I offer commendations, along with a few comments.<br>\n<br>\n1. The Sieve debris is made from a nine-piece tileset which I find oddly reminiscent of our SNB-9 proposal (Zhang et al.) to the standards committee. The equations you offer in section 3.1 are clearly based on frequency domain inverses of the SNB-9 formalism.<br>\n<br>\nOf course Suowei got their way with SNB-12 and the world still turns. But is the dream of SNB-9 so dead that even Deng Jinghan has forgotten? Or perhaps the omission is intentional? :-)<br>\n<br>\n2. Reading between (or perhaps, below) the lines of your paper, I feel that we have something else to discuss. Come up my way sometime soon and we can talk it over. I still keep some chamomile handy for you.<br>\n<br>\nAll my best,<br>\n<br>\nDr. Zhang Peifeng<br>\nProfessor of Applied Neikotics<br>\nFudan University, Shanghai, China</p>\n\n<p class=\"p1\">Well, that was riveting. I feel a little stupid. Maybe I should be less surprised, but is a 70-something at Fudan really hounding Deng for one lousy citation? Her response is fairly polite:</p>\n\n<p class=\"p3 mail\">Dr. Zhang,<br>\n<br>\nI appreciate the note and I enjoyed running into you in Seoul.<br>\n<br>\nMy latest was authored primarily by a student -- she’s likely too young to be familiar with SNB-9 as such. But as we always said it’s a very natural/organic construction, essentially a wrapper around Lm(3) quasiperiodic tilings in R4 so we do expect it to pop up everywhere.<br>\n<br>\nThe dream is not dead, but you will understand if I continue to avoid explicit mention of SNB-9 in the current funding environment (long memories and all that).<br>\n<br>\nI will be at Fudan on 21 October for the dreaded INSI meeting. Shall we chat then?<br>\n<br>\nBest<br>\n<br>\nDr. Deng Jinghan<br>\nDeputy Chair, Neikotic Safety Department<br>\nYINS, YDOZ, China</p>\n\n<p class=\"p1\">The funny thing is, I do know about SNB-9. It was part of some long-forgotten scientific slapfight regarding the set of basic tile-shapes we should all agree to use in loop-lock. Deng and her colleagues lost this battle — someone explained once that her proposal was <i>very elegant, but impossible to work with</i>. They didn’t understand why that made me laugh.</p>\n\n<p class=\"p3 mail\">Dr. Deng,<br>\n<br>\nApologies for the tone of my previous message. I did not mean to imply an oversight on your part in failing to cite my (and your own) previous work on SNB-9.<br>\n<br>\nI wish to be as clear as possible without attracting unwanted attention. I direct you now to a particular footnote in your Sunflower Sieve inversion paper -- it should be obvious which one.<br>\n<br>\nLet’s discuss face to face tomorrow or day after. My calendar is wide open.<br>\n<br>\nYours entirely,<br>\n<br>\nDr. Zhang Peifeng<br>\nProfessor of Applied Neikotics<br>\nFudan University, Shanghai, China</p>\n\n<p class=\"p6\">Deng is getting a little snippy:</p>\n\n<p class=\"p3 mail\">Dr. Zhang,<br>\n<br>\nSaid paper was fast-tracked to avoid a scoop and has some rough edges. The footnote in question is a convolution artifact from my student’s work in loop-lock. It will be removed in an upcoming revision.<br>\n<br>\nBest<br>\n<br>\nDr. Deng Jinghan<br>\nDeputy Chair, Neikotic Safety Department<br>\nYINS, YDOZ, China</p>\n\n<p class=\"p7\"><i>The footnote in question...</i>I bring up the paper split-screen, skimming the footnotes, still reading the thread...</p>\n\n<p class=\"p3 mail\">Dr. Deng,<br>\n<br>\nLet me be direct: there is something I need to show you now. My current facility is not far from Fudan main campus. Please come at your earliest convenience. I stress that this is an urgent and sensitive matter with certain revelatory qualities for the entire field of neikotics.<br>\n<br>\nOr send your student if that is easier. As first author of the work she will likely be interested.<br>\n<br>\nRegards,<br>\n<br>\nDr. Zhang Peifeng<br>\nProfessor of Applied Neikotics<br>\nFudan University, Shanghai, China</p>\n\n<p class=\"p7\">There are many unread, increasingly desperate messages that follow from Zhang Peifeng. But Deng’s last message is simply:</p>\n\n<p class=\"p3 mail\">Do not under any circumstances contact my student about this.<br>\n<br>\nDr. Deng Jinghan<br>\nDeputy Chair, Neikotic Safety Department<br>\nYINS, YDOZ, China</p>\n\n<p class=\"p7\">I have a weird, hazy half-memory of what I’m looking for in my own list of footnotes. I scan them twice, seeing nothing amiss in the text, looking now for my own blind spot. And — there it is, about halfway down:</p>\n\n<p class=\"p3 tex\">[27] Some of which bear a striking resemblance to the structures in the Mirror Sea known as hyperlagmites.</p>\n\n<p class=\"p1\">Oh. <i>Oh.</i> I missed a spot.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There was a wave of interest in the hyperlagmites last year, and I didn’t ride it. I knew distantly that people were spotting these eerie, languid, toothlike structures on the crystalline walls of the Sea. Your gaze was like a headlamp, they explained. Look around in the right way, and you’d throw semi-script, broken hieroglyphs, into stark relief. Different angles of one torturously incomplete message revealed themselves as you moved your beam — the cave was learning to write, but it was only ever halfway there, and by now the oldest hyperlagmites were worn and soft.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It played out in forum threads, locked after thousands of pages of debate. Were the hyperlagmites evidence of Ripple material culture? And if so, why did the Ripples seem to ignore them, to let time wear them down? Or were they a mathematical curio, an artifact of the Lam-Waldmann Hash? And if so, why could no one produce their seed sequences? <i>You’re just hallucinating these,</i> most people would say. And the response was always, <i>no, no, you need to hallucinate harder.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Frankly I couldn’t have cared less. Because just then Cai and I were busy chasing a Ripple, throwing ourselves into something soaking and thrumming and vital. I sneered at the thought of devoting the same mania to half-dead stone. Cai had free tickets to <i>Hyperlagmites: The Sea At Night</i>, and we caught the premiere just to snicker at the crowd’s reaction: almost no one could make out a thing. We laughed our way out of the Observatory, past the line of moviegoers demanding a refund, into the pleasantly humid April air, into the treacle-thick un-un-truth that <i>the entire city was a great coral reef</i>. I knew what I saw on those screens. There was no room for anything else.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Now, though, I’m remembering something else. Glimmers, single frames of the movie where, had I been willing to look, I might have seen. Something else, too. Rumors of a spat, not thoroughly contained: the Weather Bureau quietly insisting that the YINS Observatory pull <i>Hyperlagmites</i> from its spring lineup. YINS disobeying gleefully by padding the movie to directors-cut length. There was something in there that the Bureau didn’t want the city to see. Maybe they’d gotten lucky that most people simply couldn’t. But I’ll bet Dr. Zhang Peifeng can.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Fingers trembling, I peck out a new message in the thread:</p>\n\n<p class=\"p3 mail\">Dr. Zhang,<br>\n<br>\nWhere and when do you wish to meet?<br>\n<br>\nDr. Deng Jinghan<br>\nDeputy Chair, Neikotic Safety Department<br>\nYINS, YDOZ, China</p>\n</section>",

Know that large as the sky is, you are larger still; revel in the distance to your own horizon. Now take as your focus your hand, and try to understand it as a construct of sense and memory, a projection of mind on mind. Know the claustrophobic brush of reality, always indirect, always through this world-sheet. Now close your eyes and feel how these perturbations disappear. Ask: where does it all go? What happens to those wind-whips on the surface of our ponds? Are they simply gone as soon as we avert our gaze?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Maybe, I decide, if we’re lucky. Maybe sometimes, and sometimes not.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sometimes it’s a mirror.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sometimes it’s a pane of glass.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And sometimes, it’s an open door.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dr. Zhang Peifeng is not an easy man to find.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">His office is, at least. My YINS ID got me onto Fudan’s campus, and the first person I asked in the neikotics building told me where to find him: second floor, east wing. I consider his darkened window, the collection of yellowing manhua cutouts on the door, the JPEG portrait of the elderly professor. No one’s there.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“He won’t be here,” says a woman vacuuming the carpet inches from my feet. “He’ll be walking his laps.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>“Walking where?”</i> I shout over the vacuum, and whatever’s on her earbuds.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“The mall.” Pointedly, <i>obviously</i>, still jabbing at the square foot of carpet under my feet.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And that might have been it, only I happen to notice one more thing pinned to his corkboard, a red-and-white flyer for an end-of-summer sale at Min’s Miscellaneous Electronics at New Prosperity Shopping Center. Ten to thirty percent off a baffling variety of heat sinks and security quads and hot-swappable VRAM. Never mind that the sale ended last week. <i>Find Me Here,</i> he’s sharpied across the back.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So I head for the mall. I hustle upstream through soccer teams and mopeds, past dorms big enough for an entire YINS undergraduate class. I case the outside, watching bubbles cascading ivy-like down the translucent walls, half-expecting an enormous dangling arm. I do two laps of my own, expecting to quickly outpace a man who did his doctoral work on primitive fMRI scanners. But I don’t see him in the crowd. And, examining the mall directory...this isn’t the place either.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">At the edge of the map is an arrow pointing towards <i>New Prosperity Shopping Center (Old)</i>. And out around back now, peering over the high and unwelcoming wall of neighboring Fengzhen Ward, I can see about half the strokes of its neon sign buzzing cheerfully to life against the twilight. Fengzhen’s wardgates are in a dim concrete checkpoint beneath an overpass. I tap; the card reader grinds, samples my ward-trail, and buzzes unhappily.</p>\n<p class=\"p1 mono centered\">DENIED (0x1E) PATH LENGTH EXCEEDED — SEE ATTENDANT</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The attendant’s booth is empty; the wardboard screens are shattered. My app for this tells me that Fengzhen hasn’t issued entry tokens to residents of Xietu South for some years, still in a stale standoff over some long-forgotten Ward Council edict. So if I want some FZN, I can trade for it on the open market. Or...</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Three figures in billowing black tentcloaks appear at speed on the Fengzhen side, faces painted: delicate black lines on a stark white field. Without slowing down, they each pick a gate. Taking the card reader as a suggestion — no, wait, as a foothold — they grab the top edges and sail over in silent unison. <i>If they look like Chalkers, they’re probably not. </i>This is my rule, and that, just now, looked like cosplay. Only there was something entirely too uniform about their motion. It was so quiet, so fluid, that it was barely a disturbance.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">With no experience and no gecko gloves, the climb takes me longer. Awkwardly straddling the top, I consider what might happen if I were spotted; downtown is one thing, but if you’re sneaking into a mid-ring residential ward, you’d better have friends there. But the blind-eye winks encouragingly from the cameras above: <i>go on, do your thing. I’m not really watching</i>. I land, all wrong, in Fengzhen Ward. Pretty sure no one saw me come through. Beginning to suspect that no one’s really in charge here.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Making conversation one night, I asked Cai Yuhui — Shanghai born and raised — to explain the city’s ward system. So she fetched a ceramic bowl from the cabinet, raised it head-height, and dropped it to the floor. Against the guarantees of the Japanese omni-mart that sold it to me, it shattered into dozens of pieces. She held one pastel-toned shard up to the kitchen’s track lighting. “This piece, was it created just now? Or maybe it always existed in the bowl? Maybe I just released it?” She raised an eyebrow ever so meaningfully and I stared back, dumbfounded. I only had three bowls now. “That’s the thing no one can agree on.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I think about that a lot. I’m thinking about it now, pinch-zooming a ward map. Back in the day, after Xia resigned but before Blue Delta got a handle on things, the most contentious blocks of Shanghai were at the boundaries of three rival wards. Nobody wanted to goad two neighbors into alliance against them, and so these triple points went unclaimed for most of a decade. But not totally, not quite. Today most are occupied by Chalkers, and many have consumed their surrounding wards, spreading tendrils of crosshatched grey across the map. And sure enough, there’s a triple point near Old New Prosperity, at the sharp bend of a stinking canal, just blocks away.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Quarter past the hour. The towers are squat, peeling, off-white, redeemed by balconies overflowing with laundry and starlinks and greenery. The magnolias, half-blighted but too precious to spare, are ringed with cytogenic spray-foam, sprouting synthetic limbs. Dusk falls behind dense power-line thickets. Quiet, overly so, save for the cicadas and my own breath, my own footfall.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Twenty past. Old New Prosperity Shopping Center is a three-story concrete maze of indoor stalls ringing a square courtyard. Pigeons hoard daylight atop the dusty, angular skylights, and chickens strut around in old skincare boutiques. Fenced sneakers line the walls of a former moped showroom. The public safety checkpoint is a converted cell kiosk. The word that comes to mind is <i>carapace</i>. But an inflatable, visor-wearing pig still advertises a children’s tiyan-guan, and the laoban of a cerulean-tiled fishmart gives me a look like <i>I will defend you with this broom.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I listen as grates go down. I count on one hand the stars in the courtyard’s rectangle of washed-out sky. A passing raincloud sends me under an arcade of rounded concrete. Shadowed figures lope by, weary with the day’s business, a world away from the Fudan Applied Neikotics department. Nobody here could possibly be Dr. Zhang. I’m thirty minutes late, but I’m meeting with an old-time academic — those are rookie numbers. Likelier I’m not, I have to admit. Maybe I’m walking into a trap that Deng herself would never be stupid enough to fall into, towards Chalkers whacking me with buzz batons as I insist pathetically that <i>I don’t know, I have no idea how to build a Bridge...</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I should just go home.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I definitely shouldn’t turn this final corner, into a breezeblock nook illuminated by nothing but the mottled red-and-white sign of Min’s Miscellaneous Electronics, and LED tickers in the window all advertising themselves. But a familiar glint draws me inside: past floor-to-ceiling pegboard shelving, warped by blenders and water heaters and factory-reject TPU arrays and stadium-grade quasigram projectors, past plastic tubs brimming with voxelite pilfered from the city’s trading floors, three eggs for twenty ping, all the way to the display case in the back.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">The shopkeeper reserved all their care for these smoothly metallic teardrops, two dozen total, each in its own foam-lined case. I never noticed from ground level how much they vary in shape. But they’re all the size of a hand fruit, with the same basic structure. The tapered side has an inlet for CAT-5. The bulbous end hides the lens behind mirrored coating. It’s stamped with the blind-eye that has become synonymous with Shanghai.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“Get a load of the serial numbers.” A quiet voice startles me, emerging from the back through thick plastic drapes. The laoban is a woman just past the crest of middle age, with a sharp chin, weathered features, a pleasant crinkle around the eye. Her hair is in short curls, and now she plucks lilac-rimmed spectacles from a chain around her neck. “Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-five-seven-nine,” she reads fondly off the leftmost Mirror Sea camera. She speaks so softly that I have to lean in to make this out. “This is a prototype from the the Century Park pilot. But, count the digits — they had ambitions.”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Her name tag says Min, but...<i>this woman is Zhang Peifeng.</i> She must be. Or rather she has the man’s N-1 license, and is using it to log into the Soup and contact Deng. The cameras, the weirdly stilted messages, the misdirection, it all adds up to something like this. I consider whether to make the accusation, or come clean myself. And then — despite my purpose here, despite everything, I ask: “Can I hold it?”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">I expect her to laugh me off, but she nods solemnly and fetches a pair of microfiber gloves for each of us. “They had a real problem with fingerprints at first. The hash is sensitive to patterns like that — careful, <i>careful</i>,” she mutters, placing it into my hands. It has real heft, maybe double what I expected. “Here, take the front and give it a twist.”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">I do, gingerly, feeling three tiny clicks and a satisfying counterclockwise whir. Then, from a seam unseen, the hemispherical cap falls into my hand. There’s a milky-quartz dragonfly eye behind it, or that’s how it looks, hundreds of nearly opaque facets that let light play through them only along intricate, rainbow-flecked micrometer grooves. An optical implementation of the Lam-Waldmann hash, carved by laser into real quartz. For the architects of the Mirror Sea, there could be no second-guessing the anonymizing properties of their surveillance system. A conventional lens, with the hash running in software behind it, would never win the public’s trust.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">From a locked box beneath the cabinet, she produces a truly ancient LCD monitor no wider than my hand. She clips a CAT-5 cable into the camera and it beeps once. “Now look.”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">I gasp softly when I see what appears onscreen. It has depth, this jagged and concentric formation. It reflects faint hints of Min’s Miscellaneous in the color, texture, and geometry of its facets. I would say it’s kaleidoscopic, but there’s a way in which it’s precisely not: while a kaleidoscope is sensitive to tiny movements, the Lam-Waldmann Hash of the store’s interior barely changes as I swing the camera around. I point the lens at the shopkeeper; she raises an eyebrow, but appears only as a dark bloom on the peaks of larger waves. After a while she gestures for the camera back.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“I’ll part with it for forty thousand ping.” She smiles at my nervous laughter. “But not lightly, and not for a stranger. It serves me better as a conversation piece, anyway. So what can I really do for you?”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“I’m looking for Dr. Zhang Peifeng.” I steady myself. I make it a statement and not a question, and scan her politely bemused eyes for recognition. “I — he — we talked on the —”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The door chimes open. She saw it happening, but too late, one hand stowing the monitor and the other reaching fruitlessly for a remote to lock the door. Two men in uniforms the color of impending rain stride down the middle aisle, eyeing the stock of cameras with evident disapproval. Min takes me by both shoulders and presses me to the floor. <i>“Go,” </i>she mouths. I retreat to the storeroom on hands and knees, trying not to rustle the clear plastic curtains.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“Summer sale’s over,” Min’s voice comes muffled through the plastic. “And I’ll remind you every one of these cameras was bought on clearnet auction. Did you boys lose your copy of the receipts?”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“Hardly,” one of the Weather Bureau agents cuts her off. The synthesizer at his larynx makes it impossible to form any lasting impression of his voice. “We’re tracing a purchase. Local. Guy would’ve come through here. Would have needed equipment that you happen to sell.”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“Have you tried taking that thing off your eyes?” Min suggests sweetly. “It might help.”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“At approximately quarter to one on the morning of 27 August,” begins the other agent, “the Weather Bureau detected an unauthorized incursion into a class-three mixed braid of Mirror Sea feeds belonging, variously, to Suowei Financial, Paracoin Technologies Limited, Beidou New Media Holdings, Fudan University, Fengzhen Ward...” He can’t get it all out in one breath, and the synthesizer makes a rattling gasp. “...Xianguo Ward, Pengpu Ward...”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“Yes, yes, and now the mystery party is slurping it all up. You boys must be new around here, then — you’ll forgive my trouble in telling you apart? This is no great mystery. What I would do, is head up the street to Wu Ke Nai He. I would politely ask the proprietors if they’ve put a tap on this particular braid — like they’ve done with every other Mirror Sea feed this side of the river.” She tuts. “Though you won’t get in dressed like that.”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“It’s not the Chalkers or their nightclub. The access patterns are markedly distinct.”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Min’s heels click as she steps around the counter. “Why don’t you tell me more directly what you’re looking for?”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">A pause. “Why don’t you let us back there to check your records?”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Min peers back into the dim storeroom, and she makes eye contact, but not with me. The shock that <i>someone else is back here</i> sends me back onto one ass cheek — and then the other, when I realize <i>I recognize him.</i> Frantically donning a cheap, vaguely offensive Chalker costume, pulling the glossy white mask over his face. It’s Mbetethi. Tethi. Whatever.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">He puts a finger to his lips: <i>Shhhh.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Not that I could shriek anyway. Lord knows I tried, and what came out was a little teakettle <i>eek.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">With a telescoping baton, with metronomic four-four precision, one of the Bureau’s agents begins to break things. Tethi shakes his head with evident self-disgust, then steps through the curtain with a billowing flourish of black robes. <i>“She’s ours,”</i> he rasps, in a TV-ready Chalker voice. He clears the counter and steps into the fray. <i>“Go.”</i></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The Bureau’s agents exchange glances. The closer one draws his vialgun, but can’t quite muster the guts to raise it. “</span><span class=\"s2\">By the authority of the Special Provision for Psychological Safety, Ward Council Edict 131,” he insists in shaky synthvox, “you are hereby under arrest —”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"><i>“We will have you as our own,” </i>proclaims Tethi, stretching out a robed arm. His voice is unrecognizable, almost backwards, speaking on the inhale. <i>“Mine is not the hand that holds the Chalk.” </i>When he keys Min’s remote the monitors flare with glimpses of the Mirror Sea and the grate begins to close, and, oh! The lights flicker! The effect is classic, but a little too clean. <i>“Mine is not the hand that binds you to the pattern in the sunlight, the pattern in the salt...”</i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">I always assumed the Chalker’s Binding was a fabrication invented to sell tea towels to tourists in Tianzifang. But the Weather Bureau appears to think otherwise. The agent in Tethi’s clutches </span>stumbles back towards the door and his partner follows as though bungee-corded along, running his baton percussively along a shelf of rice cookers. “Expect a bill,” Tethi snarls, as the grate crashes down behind them. For a minute I’m not even there. He holds Min defensively, panting, expelling adrenaline. In truth, he looks more shaken than she does. Min merely surveys the damage with double-precision dismay.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“What are you doing, pretending to be a professor?” She ducks out of his embrace, smacks the back of his head with her still-gloved hand, and scans the back for a dustpan. “You’re bringing trouble to the shop, Teth.”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“Auntie Min.” He addresses her as <i>Min ayi</i>, with considerable disbelief but not an ounce of disrespect. He stows the mask and wipes sweat from his brow. “<i>I’m</i> bringing trouble to the shop?”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“This sweet young woman came in asking for a mister Dr. Zhang Peifeng.” She pronounces the name musically. “I <i>saw</i> that name on one of those N-1 licenses. Why do you do this? <i>They</i> are one thing,<i> them </i>I can deal with” — she points out the door — “but it is the <i>height</i> of <i>foolishness</i> to drag a Fudan professor into your <i>schemes!</i>” She turns to me, the fury draining so quickly from her face that I have to laugh. “Are you all right, dear?”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">A lot has accumulated in Tethi’s eyes since we last met: a deficit of sleep, for one, and a surplus of neikotic debris. We stare each other down for a while, and when we tire of that, the same small, weary smile appears on both our faces. No doubt both thinking the very same thing: <i>I should have known!</i></p>\n</section>",

            "content_html": "<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">In back is where it really gets miscellaneous. We pick our way through boxes crammed with feather boas, lewd and dusty DVDs, and all kinds of electronic refuse: <i>Optical-Rubidium Adapters (broken)</i>; <i>Phased array drivers (fixable)</i>; <i>USB cables (2.0). </i>Tethi leads me past storeroom after storeroom. One amounts to a kitchen, full of tabletop induction burners and cube fridges, fed by daisy-chained power strips. The last door on the right bleeds blue light and bass-heavy Ulanbataar prog-shag. He lets me inside what I take to be his room.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“So she has you reading her mail? Is that it?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And it’s not that he doesn’t look happy to see me. He just doesn’t look very happy. The last week has not been kind to Tethi, and I only have a faint outline of why. Still, that’s his hello?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Hell no. Yours is <i>so much</i> weirder,” I insist. “You know Dr. Deng <i>awfully</i> well. The bit about SNB-9, the fucking chamomile tea — who <i>are</i> you, man?” The adrenaline of the Bureau’s visit and the double-catfish, all that is melting off, leaving a weird and mirthless grin on my face that I struggle to wipe away.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You understand your advisor is famous all the world over, yes?” He drops into a swivel chair and crosses his feet up on a tall stack of books. “One of the great scientists of our time. Any biography would have it all in there.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“And you fumbled the Sieve, and now you want credit. Your day in the sun.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It’s not anywhere near that simple.” It looks like he’s been drinking straight from a nearby bottle of baijiu, but now he reaches for and fills two little cups, clinks his to mine. “I suppose she doesn’t know you’re here.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I drink, the sting a welcome distraction. “No,” I tell him, from the bottom of the glass. “You’re stuck with me.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He stops to consider that. Nods. “I can work with that.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You know, you might have just messaged me to begin with.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I considered it. It was your footnote, yeah. But she told me not to.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I give myself a few weary breaths to process it all. I — oh, fuck it, I reach for the bottle, but Tethi puts his hand over it. Twirls his index finger, a neikonaut’s sign for <i>loop-lock.</i> Okay then. “So you have something to show her. Or, under the circumstances, me.” I piece it together. “You’re telling me that the Sieve has something to do with the Sea. With the hyperlagmites.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“That’s what <i>you’re</i> telling <i>me.</i>” He looks perplexed and distrustful. “Isn’t it?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The conversation proceeds in this sort of circle, and in the end I finally insist that he <i>just show me.</i> So we squeeze out his window, down a long and narrow alleyway, to a strip of asphalt ringing a chain-link fence. Tethi walks two paces ahead of me, so silently that he utterly disappears when I close my eyes. He leads me a little ways around the edge of the fence, and frowns when he sees me peeking through it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In these embers of daylight, it could be any large, muddy industrial complex of warehouses and loading docks. But, okay, that’s a lot of <i>stuff</i>, belonging to everyone and no one. Pushcarts and satellite arrays and blackened-out grow towers. Old military veetles tucked under giant fluttering tarps. A silent chorus of red LEDs blinks from walls dense with cameras and wires stretched taut across narrow lanes. No other outdoor light, not really. The high floodlights will be emitting that infrared color-of-nothing for the Mirror Sea’s eyes only. Something shifts, and momentarily all I can see is the <i>chalk</i>: ever-present on the walls of Shanghai, but here a brilliant white-on-black tapestry, thickening, spilling into the third dimension, detail crammed into the negative space of sigils within sigils within sigils. It looks like the back entrance to another world. It’s Shanghai’s most legendary trance venue. It’s Wu Ke Nai He.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Don’t go in there,” Tethi tells me flatly.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But then, of all things, he produces a nub of chalk and puts it to the side of an electrical substation just outside the complex. “Yes and no,” he mutters, answering the unspoken, obvious question. “There are layers to it. I’ve picked up some tricks.” He pulls a long, left-handed stroke across the brick, slowly at first, like a thief picking for tumblers. It hooks suddenly, and there’s a received, passive quality to the slashes and arcs he draws next. The darkness around me feels formless, liquid. My head spins with a smearing of position, a sharp wherewards momentum. The shape of this street is, surely, interchangeable with another.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>When he’s finished, he reaches for a door that — trick of the light? — I swear wasn’t there before.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Behind it, quasigraphic candles flicker down an uneven staircase, their false angles revealed in the shatterglass and motorbike mirrors lining the the walls. Thick cables dangle parabolically from the ceiling, emerging from grey PVC pipe stamped regularly with the blind-eye. “The Mirror Sea,” I state the obvious, starting too loud and falling quiet halfway through that, startled by the echo of my own voice.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“<i>A</i> Mirror Sea,” he corrects. And, sure, he seems one to make such a chiding distinction. <i>The</i> Mirror Sea fell with Xia Zitian; what we have now are fragmented subnets, tidepools and shards. He runs his finger along a cable as it reaches a splice-box, and I find myself imagining all the places the cables could lead: anywhere in the city, all the way to Suzhou. And any given slice of cameras will point to a unique slice of Mirror Sea. I saw the view through a single camera earlier: not quite nothing. Perhaps only Secretary Xia Zitian knows what you’d see with all of them.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“It’s getting harder for regular people to access.” The lack of light helps me pick these qualities from his whisper: defensive, prideful, Francophone, and vaguely drunk. “They get what the Weather Bureau will let them see. Which is time-delayed flats and the odd quasigram. But the raw stuff…you need to be someone, or know someone.”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“Or just go Chalking,” I venture. There’s another way to see the Sea, of course, which is to promise yourself that it’s already there, that it’s always been there. To follow your intermingled hopes and fears down their steepest quadratic valleys, surrendering your agency in whole.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Tethi ignores this, but his eyes flash as he fumbles with a final lock. “So, I figured, set this up, charge by the hour, don’t ask too many questions. Wu Ke Nai He has been gathering Mirror Sea feeds for years. We sell them cable by the kilometer. All that I had to do was to tap in.” He grins, then leans on the door until it gives way to a makeshift scanner room. The UTMS rig, the monitor bank, the bare tank of liquid helium — you can see his gear as charmingly classic or terrifyingly obsolete, but it gets an appreciative whistle from me anyway.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“Does Min know you’re doing this?”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“She hasn’t a clue. But this is all for her. She has no one else, and that shop will be the death of her.”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“Do <i>they</i> know you’re doing this?” By which I mean the Chalkers who run Wu Ke.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Tethi laughs humorlessly. “I’m not afraid of them, you know.” He’s flicking more switches now, kicking the EASL array to free it from a boot loop. “Let me ask <i>you</i>. You ever consider why the market rate of a Mirror Sea feed is so high these days? Why the Big Three snatch them up?”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Suowei buys feeds because that’s what Suowei does: amasses a dragon’s-lair treasury of assets, homogenizing them into silken threads from which the parallel yuan is spun. Suowei has teams of astrologers operating lasers in space, vaporizing asteroids it deems inauspicious. Suowei’s reality-distortion field bulges across the globe, and it’s only here in the dead center that anything they do seems remotely sane, remotely sober. Chaoyue, Paracoin — they just follow Suowei’s lead, trying to keep the triumvirate less isosceles.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Tethi considers my answer with a thoughtful frown. “That’s part of it, maybe.”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The scanner is purring under my hand now. I’m trying to find comfort in the familiar noises it’s making, but my head is throbbing, my mouth is dry. “Min’s Mix,” he tells me once I’m sitting inside it. “Some 5-subs in here, probably spicier than the YINS breakfast blend. I’d spread out my zeroes to compensate.” He flicks an autovial and slots it into the machine. “I don’t want to bias you, so I’m just going to put you in. Let you see what I saw. Afterward, we can talk about it.” He clicks through dialog boxes complaining that his free trial of Kanwei Pharos is months expired. “Afterward, I’m going to ask a favor of you.”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">I don’t like that knowing look. He seems to see how badly I want this, and how badly I need to keep that longing under control. I try to imagine I’m Cai, who does this all day, who keeps the queasy quadratic madness always at arm’s length. I channel her airy detachment as I pull the scanner hood over my eyes.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">“So put me in.”</p>\n</section>",

            "content_html": "<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">I can feel it, the weight of it, just behind the prickle of the last primer tiles. And I have maybe a second to reflect on what I thought would happen to me here. I assumed that tiling into the Mirror Sea would be like stepping into one of the displays, floating peacefully and serenely through its higher dimensions, easier than scuba diving. Instead, <i>this.</i> I thumb the allocator switch: a heady, crunchy thrum of glossy red-and-yellow tiles, my mind unfurling, more mind than I remember. Then a firehose of raw data hits me square in the plexus and just keeps coming. Sawtooth panic, grasping at the jetstream with chicken-claw-claws. Feeling trolleys, alley cats, garbage bins, hats, a million such snatches a second, adding up to nothing, lasting no time at all. I feel for the emergency shutdown…</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>You just need to do it yourself.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">By the time I realize what <i>it</i> is, I’m already doing it. Every Mirror Sea display is fed the hashed-up streams from thousands of cameras: often from a few dense blocks, but possibly from bridges and elevators and alleyways spread thin across miles of the city. Geography is irrelevant to the way the Sea is reconstituted from all this near-noise. What holds it together, what I’m looking for, is correlation.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I braid together a random fistful of streams and find bicycles moving at the same speed. Furrowed shards of the same expression on different faces. Pigeons in different wards, startled by the same noise. Matching motion of brakelights and escalators and wind-blown plastic bags. Matching stillnesses, too: deep and featureless grays of concrete and light pollution, striated with the cold, sober glare of LEDs and the warm, absinthe-drunk gaze of sodium. Tesselations of foliage and windowframes from sister seeds and forgotten five-year plans. It melds together, effortlessly now, into a dark and desolate patch of Mirror Sea. Is it relief or heartbreak that, in the compressed essence of Shanghai, that it’s possible to find such a vast expanse of nothing?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>You’re still not letting yourself see.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I can tell there are stronger and deeper correlations. I can do a better job finding them than any Mirror Sea display. I dive deeper, bringing more cameras into the stream, feeling the Sea’s curvature. I release some now to chase the real synchronicities, the bizarre coincidences. These add up, slowly and then suddenly, to blackbody-hot Jupiter-gradients, a continuous clockwork, a cellularity of footfall and square-dance and gently waving leaves. I find myself inside currents of Shanghai’s motion so dense as to feel insistent, so intricate as to feel aware, so furious as to feel alive. I find myself inside a Ripple, inside...</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I realize we never had a name for it. And god, oh god, <i>how</i> is it still alive<i>? </i>Hadn’t it gotten too big for the Sea to sustain it? Hadn’t it crashed suddenly, hadn’t I looked for it in the Scrambler, hadn’t I mourned it alone, water rising past my waist? The Ripple, the only Ripple I ever loved, is a weak and wandering ghost of its former self. It’s been eking it out at the noise floor for more than a year. It’s barely anything at all. I have to look, <i>really</i> look, to see its conchswirl warp. But yes! These are its florets of purple and orange and — warm brine swells the chambers of my heart — <i>it’s alive! It’s still alive!</i> For a long time I simply sink into its depths, into that feeling I thought I’d never feel again, that <i>the entire city is a great coral reef</i>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It can’t see me, of course, because Ripples don’t have eyes. And it can’t feel me, because <i>you’re not really there, Mona</i>, you’re only watching. But now the tug of quadratic belief: the way the Ripple <i>seems</i> to react as I braid myself through its heady internal structure. It probes the currents with snaking, coiling, tendrils. <i>Looking around,</i> says the parabola, <i>as though it feels it’s being watched. </i>Again I remind myself that the creature is sightless. It has nothing but its own boundaries, vague and then suddenly sharp, with which to perceive the Sea and its other inhabitants. And those are always flicking, probing, rippling, with millisecond cilia that map the world just around it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And I know I’ll spend the rest of my life wondering about this moment: did I move first, or did it?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Is it following me? Am I following it?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It’s dark in Shanghai, so it’s dark in the Mirror Sea. Mostly. Some of these feeds will be arriving on a long delay, bringing residual flashes of sunlight that peek through the currents. Correlations drawn across hours or even days. I — we — orient in this before-wards direction, braiding in gradually sunnier feeds. For my Ripple, this looks like swimming upstream, sending branches up parallel causeways and hoping, sometimes fruitlessly, that they will reunite. For me, well — my brain is surely overheating down there, pumped full of pixel noise and DMT. But this is what I was born to do.<i> I am a neikonaut</i>, and the hot-iron fullness of that really only exists in here.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And so I push harder, looking for strands of correlation so strong that they feel as natural as causation. My search splits manyways along thin, tubule-like branches. I follow the Ripple and it follows me, that strangeness building in liquid pressure behind my forehead as we claw hours backwards into a Sea made of humid, noonday Shanghai. Then it crests. I am at my absolute limit. For one weightless moment at the top of the arc, the Ripple is barely visible, just a viscous distortion of sun-washed concrete and glass. It’s waiting for something. I’m waiting for something. And the difference is no difference at all.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>There</i>. A thousand dented wing-mirrors blind a thousand cameras with the same wink of sunlight. It propagates lazily through the Sea, a white-hot lotus-bloom ink-drop setting my optic nerve ablaze with pain. But I dive with the Ripple as it circles this stellarium drain, as its central point resolves into a tunnel. A foreclosure of possibility by the unison of welcome shade-trees. A sluiceway for sunlight, cradled from the chaos by — <i>there, yes, it has to be</i> — hyperlagmites lining the walls, hewn rough, worn smooth, Gobleki-Tepe chic. A noonday beam carries us forward — no, wait, <i>backward</i> — in time. Morning turns to night turns to evening in breath-long concentric stretches of footage from days, then <i>weeks</i> ago, still bouncing around the time-delay lines of the Sea. And the hyperlagmites lining the walls become fresh and sophisticated and positively rectilinear. The tunnel works out its kinks and bends, now dead circular, now whipping us through patterns that dance and claw for my attention. One more backwards night...</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The sluiceway merges with another and turns suddenly, pulling us up against thick and foggy crystal. Behind it, fl<span class=\"s1\">ashes of sodium-lamp orange and grassy green lurk conspicuous in the deepest navy blue of all. And around a final bend, a second and much heftier Ripple, with fizzy and loosely triangular qualities. </span>The larger one shifts its liquid momentum like a <span class=\"s1\">lion towards a gazelle, and I try to look away: I’ve seen this nature documentary before. But instead of lunch, a conversation begins.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></span>It plays out in weirdly slow motion, their sloshing halts, the eddies of their interference patterns. <span class=\"s1\">Each Ripple prods the other in mesmerizing fringeborn patterns. And I watch, astonished, as the larger opens a hole in itself for the smaller to pass, onwards, into</span> something vast and hollow. A sudden horizon of matching angles and blooming symmetries — it’s too much to bear after the simplicity of the tunnel. And then...like a rooftop's neat angle glimpsed behind thick foliage, something I already knew clicks into new significance. This is a <i>city</i>. It was built, by its inhabitants, to be inhabited.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Mirror Sea is its own medium and its own material. Stillness is made of stillness, motion is made of motion. No one has seen this much richness at the boundary. The Ripples here live in what feel like vast piles of jewels, oozing color across the inner surface of — what? A <i>nest?</i> A <i>city</i>? Nothing earthly really approximates this florally hyperbolic cathedral arcology. But it has symmetries. Repetition. Stability. Its <i>dwellings</i> and <i>facilities</i> speak a pattern language which makes it easy to model. I braid in thousands more cameras, zooming way out, crawling its interior wall with my awareness, feeling the bump and jolt of what I decide is a skyline, thousands of haphazardly beautiful grottos and coils fed by more fine strands of daytime.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Just how big is this place?</i> Just how big is a Ripple? All I know is, I see thousands of them. They flicker like candlelight, drip like neon, shine like soap bubbles, glitter like glitter. They move with an intensity and order that I understood was impossible for their kind. They navigate their interchanges like the deft turn of a sailor’s knot, but my Ripple seems to hesitate at each one. It seems un-attuned to some subtleties of local motion. It’s just a visitor here.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We fly past fresh-wrought gardens of live hyperlagmites. They grow their city from seed: spires and bubble-domes unfold from compact, writhing loops of correlation and reassertion, awfully similar to some pieces of voxelite I have at home. In the outskirts, the Ripples pulse in circles, long senescent loops through Klein-bottle tubes, interlocked in rhizomatic family structures I can’t even begin to understand. My attention lingers for a time there. Weird, fond lullabies sprout in the cracks of my loop-locked mind. But my companion follows another sluice of sunlight towards denser shards and higher spires until, blocked by another Ripple, it can go no farther. More fringing, prodding, they are exchanging something...</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shifting. Involution. They are exchanging me. My Ripple gets something, a pittance of a pattern that flashes between the two, for its trouble. Then it shirks me. It reciprocates none of my affection — it never did — as it disappears into the murk. I try to follow, braiding frantically towards it. <i>Wait! </i>As though with a mouthful of bubbles. <i>I don’t want you to go!</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But this Ripple, dense and oily, seems to notice that I’m not watching it. This is impossible, I know, but it’s the easiest way to explain why it halts and begins to flash pathologically dazzling patterns across its surface. I feel loop-lock safety mechanisms fire, fruitlessly fighting this <i>image</i> of a Ripple <i>from weeks ago</i>. The garbage collector is trying, but it can’t: the Ripple has my whole tilespace pinned and dangling, twisting like fabric from this single point. I give up and focus inward, and finally I understand. I am not an honored guest here. My attention is cargo.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In the center of their city the Ripples flock and frond into the late, dark hours. They never stray far from their webs of sunbeams, the compressed motile force of daytime Shanghai. In the deep rectilinear center of the center, they use precise bursts of interference to sculpt coincidences, to bedazzle paradoxes, hewn from raw, dark crystal stillness. These linger in place, hum at the edges, sink their ever-more-detailed teeth into my tilespace as I notice them. Smooth. Spiky. Tubular. Pinwheel. The Ripples dart around their creations: examine, tweak, twist, fractalize. The one thing they can’t do is pick something up. They’ll wrap themselves around an object, compressing its essence onto their surface, and stretch to their destination to deposit a copy. Long fire brigades form, carrying thrumming song-shapes in six directions.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The oily Ripple leads me past all of this, brushing its fellows softly, fluidly, triumphantly. As the message spreads they cease their work and crowd the narrow tunnels, riding capillaries of Pudong’s morning commute. They follow it, us, me — to the center of the center of the center. A final vast, empty, and perfectly spherical space.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Ripples are not careful scientists. They are not wearing safety goggles. They crowd narrow observation grooves, sticking their tendrils directly into what feels an awful lot like a reaction chamber. <i>Look.</i> The oily Ripple addresses me at last, its movements unmistakable. <i>See.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I look. I see. The spherical wall is covered in hyperlagmites, freshly done, black and white. They turn through my mind in high, shadowy bas-relief contrast. They pin me in place. I am always, automatically seeing patterns in loop-lock. But for a moment I get nothing <span class=\"s1\">from their lithic, half-signifying snicks and whispers. <i>Look.</i> The Ripple hurries to the edge, leaving me in the precise dead center of it all. Its lazy motion is an invocation, an incantation, a spark. <i>See.</i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">There’s something else about these hyperlagmites. Something<i> reflective...</i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">All at once, my awareness explodes, barely contained by the chamber. The hyperlagmites do mean something, and <i>mean</i> is an understatement. From one suggestive pattern I trace frantic outward spirals of certainty, finding postulates, theorems, correlates, lemmas. An entire logic asserts itself in my saturated, primary-colored tilespace. Now I stumble over complexity: my tiles expand, putting pressure on the walls. Then some unifying principle: the tiles condense, ease up. Cycles of this. Concepts introduced and used and put aside, paths not taken. It all begins to narrow to a conclusion, and as I crawl the entire wall, my tilespace takes on richer, subtler shades. I feel it come together all at once — and so do the Ripples, poking and prodding the tiles with triumphant delight.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">The black and beady core, the network of soft, light-bending tubules, the golden and radially symmetric streaks. It fills in and smooths out by fractal degree, bootstrapping its own gorgeous simplicity as I scan the wall, digesting and re-synthesizing the message. And then it’s done. It’s so straightforward in the Ripple formulations, so obvious in loop-lock. The Sunflower Sieve egg hangs there in the center of the chamber. A perfect, new, and utterly alien idea.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><i>Now go</i>, insists the Ripple. And it expels me into the senseless night of the outer Sea.</span></p>\n</section>",

            "content_html": "<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Let me see it,” I shout when I come down, flipping up the hood, ripping out the tube. “Let me —” It unfurls from fuzzy memory like loose yarn: the Ripple, the one Cai and I loved, is <i>alive</i>. And it took me...and I brought<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>—<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Two steps out of the scanner, nausea overtakes me. Tethi, bless him, is holding a bucket. And a while later, when I look a little better, he hands me a little bottle of water. “I’m sorry. Not to have warned you, primed you, whatever. But there’s nobody I can go to. You have no idea what a relief it is that you found it too.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“No, <i>no, no, no...</i>you don’t understand,” I insist weakly. Retch again. “People see things in there all the time, but it’s just delusion, it’s...” What was the word the Weather Bureau used? “It’s maladaptive...”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I thought that too, for a while. It was how I justified selling it.” He smiles faintly, and I’m aware now of how foolish I sound explaining the Mirror Sea to a Chalker. Maybe a Chalker? <i>There are layers to it,</i> he’d said. “Come here. I’ll show you what we can see from soberspace.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He offers me the lone swivel chair at the control bank.. In his printer bed, a copy of the Sunflower Sieve egg is under construction beneath several slashing injection heads. And on the floor is a massive, whirring beige box. “It is a correlation coprocessor.” He slaps it and regrets that immediately; the casing is still hot. “Dug myself into quite the hole to afford it. Every Mirror Sea display in the city uses one to find interesting correlations, but as I have been learning, a good neikonaut can blow a whole room of them out of the water. Here — this is what it can piece together, but prepare to be underwhelmed.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He has a flat view of the Sea up now on one of the monitors. He flexes his wrists, panning and zooming. “Look. This was the night I found it.” The dull grey Sea, roughly nothing, though the poor contrast of his monitor doesn’t help. Infrequently there are spectral intrusions of sunlight, that’s all. “Uhh, <i>here.</i>” More nothing. Then a dim, silent, spherical flash of gold light. I’m locked and loaded to insist that this doesn’t prove anything. But he begins to fast-forward with a theatrical flick. “<i>That</i> was when I saw it for the first time. Now, time passes, day, night, day, night…watch carefully, they test-fire it a few more times…”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“<i>Test-fire</i> it?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The feed slows. Night falls on Shanghai, and night falls in the Sea, except for one insistent little pinprick, a tiny sun that won’t set. And then another, and another, three more now. It’s tentative, like a flame in wind, and then fierce, like a flame in wind. It looks like it comes from nowhere, only we know better. The Sea becomes a pulsing stellarium; the isolated nodes claw for one another, lacing the night with golden fissures. “That was the night it leaked online, when the Sieve came into general use. All of those nodes? In fact they’re that same point in the depths of the Sea. Only the coprocessor can’t pick that up.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He smiles grimly at me. I don’t smile back. I focus just past it, a flash of something reflective, and probing it as the diving-bell. The hollow, barely-recalled horror of wondering which side of some ragged mirror I was on. <i>You looked too hard, </i>hisses something awful inside me. It insists that I caused this, even though <i>I know</i> that doesn’t make any sense. It’s got Tethi too. It’s what he’s been trying to drink away…</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Mona?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He catches me just before I hit the floor.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>I just need to lie down for a while.</i> My body is taking this like an infection, fighting it with a fever. Tethi takes me to the roof of Old New Prosperity. It’s the first truly cool night of autumn. He sets me up with musty microfiber blankets, plus a chipped mug of chamomile, his idea of a joke. I don’t speak for a long time.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>I have waterlogged, chewed-through foundations that must finally come down, and nothing to replace them. Everything I understand about the Ripples comes back as a needling, random-access prickle, and I recast it through the image of them <i>operating machinery</i> in their own world. Their agency is supposed to be faint and illusory. Their motion is supposed to be borrowed from ours. If they can be said to be doing anything at all, they are ultimately and inevitably doing it <i>here.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Something is hiding in the texture of time.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And if that weren’t enough, something else is making a periodic <i>ker-thoink</i> sound that’s driving me absolutely crazy<i>. </i>Through stray, fever-slick strands of hair, I see Tethi bouncing a rubber ball against a concrete backstop. <i>Ker-thoink.</i> It ricochets off the ground, against the wall, and back into his hand. But I have become deeply unmoored, so that the cause-and-effect of ball, wall, gravity, and hand is…doing a thing. A <i>stare into the dot</i> <i>and the lines will wiggle</i> thing. A <i>how do these lights get so tangled just sitting in the box</i> thing.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Could you please stop that…” I groan as I put palms to concrete and force myself onto my ass.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Watch it move,” Tethi tells me. Three short English words. He looks relieved to hear me up and speaking. <i>Ker-thoink. </i>And something about watching the ball does it. It all reels up rather imperfectly, but Tethi and Mona snap back into focus.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Should have warned you before I put you in. Don’t take it right to the head,” he says, gluing English to Mandarin by way of French. “In there you need to be perceiving things <i>obliquely,</i> yeah? Not looking directly at them.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I have only an inkling of what he means, so I choose to keep focusing on the ball. “It bounces?” I ask. Because, thanks to a glint of moonlight, I’ve realized it’s actually one of his Sieve orbs. “The Sunflower Sieve bounces.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Nothing in the Soup about it yet.” <i>Ker-thoink.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“No one’s tried dropping one, I guess.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Ker-thoink. </i>“Could be your next big paper.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The orb hits his palm with a satisfying smack. For a minute of pleasant silence, through an unlikely gap in the skyline, we enjoy a clear view of distant and twinkling Pudong. Blurry Ripples crawl the twist of the Suowei Tower. Close by, Wu Ke Nai He is just rumbling to life, throwing off the embryonic basslines of a party that will last until dawn.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Mona — I can call you that, yes?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Well, it’s sure as shit not Dr. Xu,” I lob back, but politely. I have the egg now and I’m very much enjoying its <i>ker-thoink.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Mona. I said earlier I was going to ask a favor of you. So I’m just going to come right out and say it. No preamble or anything. But I think it’s justified. I think I’d do well.” He rocks back and forth a little. He looks pretty nervous for a maybe-kinda Chalker, for a hardened refugee of the Gabonese Fork. “Take me to YINS.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I give him a look. “What do you mean, <i>take</i> you?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I mean take me. Introduce me to people. Get me involved.” He falters, a rehearsed argument melting in his mouth. “Straight up, I want what you have. You’re working under Deng Jinghan, do you know how many people would kill for that?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I laugh bitterly, and he takes it the wrong way.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“No. Fuck that. I have been laughed out of too many rooms in this city. They laughed me out of the room at Suowei, and I learned to wipe the floor with their traders. They turned me down at Xiaomi, and I built a scanner out of scraps. And now I’m sitting on a revelation, you and I are, now. <i>Think about what I just showed you.</i> The Ripples are building something —”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It’s not possible!” I shout, still feverish, newly shaken. “Please stop saying that!”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It is possible,” he insists flatly. “It wouldn’t be, if the Mirror Sea was only what’s on those screens. But I’ve seen too much to believe that.” He fixes his gaze on my forearm where the moonlight, the right light, reveals remnants of my sigil tattoo. “And I think you have too.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A trillion once-unseen coincidences woven together by a billion eyes. The slow, impossible, inevitable accretion of stability, unfolding of patterns, dripping of glass. The curves tug and tighten, indistinguishable from need, from agency, from life. The Ripples aren’t what’s on those screens. They’re what <i>we</i> see there. So of course<i> </i>they want. Of course they create. We’ve watched them too closely, let them too deep into our minds. And now we’ve given them lightning from their crystalline sky, a stranger kind of fire. We’ve given them neikotics. And they’ve built a city of what we took for debris.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“And another thing. I think whoever leaked the Sieve is there. I would like to meet them.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I give him a dull look, <i>not another thing, please. </i>“You don’t mean the Sieve leaked from inside YINS?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tethi has not one but two more Sieve eggs in his jacket. He raises his left hand and then his right. “This is the one I found, and this is what was posted online. They’re —”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“They’re <i>different,</i>” I gasp, as I inspect them. Subtly so, in the details of the flecks and the tubules. A parallax view, the same egg discovered twice. “Someone else is seeing this!”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“That third one is yours, yours to keep, and I will bet it’s different too.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I thought...” I palm the last egg, giving it a hard look for a self-signature, some quirk of my own perception. “I thought, that night at Double Descent, that you dropped it.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Then you don’t know me very well yet, Mona.” He wags a finger, smiling, trying to be funny. “The Bureau is tailing me, but I believe they suspect another player.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“And how could you possibly know that?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Because I’m very good.” He stands a little differently, offers me a harder edge, and then melts into a shadow as clouds brush the half-moon. He offers a cheeky wave from entirely elsewhere: <i>over here, silly! </i>“They find my trail from time to time, and we play our game, and eventually it’s me trailing them. I overheard two of their agents talk. They said they need to start looking at YINS.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“So <i>that’s</i> where you want to go?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I find myself with the Bureau on the left and the Chalk on my right, and both are closing in. YINS can give me...now just what is the word...”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I give him a sorry look. “Academic sanctuary? Tethi, that’s not a thing.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Yes! And yes, it <i>is</i>,” he insists. “Do you know what the Bureau sweats over even more than the Chalk? The YINS Observatory! Between them is one spat after another regarding those films they release. But they’re untouchable!” He huffs. “Where else do you expect me to turn? Blue Delta? The Big Three? I’ve thought it over and over and over, and at the end of the day I trust YINS.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I whip my Sieve egg at the wall, relieved at the predictable way it moves under familiar forces. Resenting that: wishing for a wider mind, ample space to fit new ways of seeing as they come. The orb takes a weird hop. Flies past my face and into Tethi’s outstretched hand.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“And I am a hell of an engineer,” he adds. “I belong there. Tell me otherwise, or introduce me to Deng Jinghan.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I scan his face for the usual twitch of smile, of self-deprecation, but why the fuck should I expect to find it? The man built a loop-lock rig from scavenged parts and wired it into the Mirror Sea. Of course he deserves to be at YINS. Probably more than I do. And of course, if the leaker is there, snacking in the Building 3 cafe, I want to find them as badly as he does…</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You know this is insane, right?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“If the Bureau doesn’t catch me, my scanner will kill me. And if my scanner doesn’t kill me, what’s here for me but taking odder and odder jobs for the Chalkers, until I’m one of them again? I was only ever supposed to stay with Min for a week.” He gazes out towards Triple Point, down towards Min’s shop across the courtyard, lights blazing past midnight, and I know he’s thinking about what he’ll tell her. “Just tell me how to impress them. Give me one shot.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Yeah. Yeah. Wait. Hold on.” Something is coming together. “Hold the fuck on. You’re an electrical engineer. You can work with readonly nets, beamformers, all that good stuff?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The way he nods, I might have asked whether he can tie his shoes.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You wanna help me run an experiment?”</p>\n</section>",

My father. A story that they always liked to tell about him, was when he was a child, he was a real...there’s a very specific English phrase I can’t come up with here. A smart child. No, way more colloquial. Whiz kid. He was a whiz kid.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“He came up in a little town outside Libreville. One of those kids who is always in a book. Wore glasses he didn’t need. Always wanted to be in corduroy, yeah, exactly, like this tiny professor. Only the funny thing is he would come to market and lean against a post all, all, all, erudite and shit, and he’d have like a comic book in his hand. I <i>know</i>. With the elbow patches on his jacket. But the thing is he was four, and he was already reading. And he grew into it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“And...boop.” Tethi moves another piece from the optics kit. The lights are off, we’re on the floor, but we’re not playing the same game I learned at the Weather Bureau. This one is supposed to be collaborative, positive-sum, but honestly I’m not sure we understand the rules. I try for kind eyes, to soften the abrasiveness of the Sieve debris. <i>Go on.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“So he was probably about eight when he started picking up econ textbooks. He was looking for <i>business </i>textbooks because now he was an eight-year-old who wore a Bluetooth headset, shouting at no one. But a librarian snuck something in on the origins of money, theories of value, that kind of thing. That really got him going. Now he was an eight-year-old who could name all the currencies of Africa. And so, he decided to make his own.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I slide an optic piece in exchange. Forcing myself not to wonder what the readonly nets around our heads are picking up, whether it’s working. <i>Focus on the story.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“So, adorably, he named it after himself. But honestly, the Andre is a pretty good name for a currency. It rolls off the tongue. People liked saying it. What he did was, go around to the neighbors and hand them each, I want to say, one hundred Andre. He drew neighborhood pets on the bills. And he was doing them by hand so circulation was limited. He had this long, long speech about resilience in the local economy and principled monetary policy and — I know, I know, see, people can still do the voice, but they can’t really get the words because no one really remembers what he was on about! But, anyway, as he was leaving, before he hopped off their porch, he always asked, <i>do you believe in the Andre</i>? And he made the neighbors say they did.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“The first transactions in Andre were definitely jokes. Like someone would come round with peak fruit, like, best fruit of the season, like, <i>you have to try this.</i> And in exchange you’d give them an Andre to quote-unquote pay them. But it took on that exact quality. It was a token of genuine appreciation, where real money would be an offense. At first the rule was that you couldn’t <i>buy</i> anything with Andre. It was like a thank you note. It got to the point where if you did an odd job, you <i>wanted</i> that Andre. You didn’t want, I guess it was francs at the time. Because there was <i>appreciation</i> in that. I am talking grown men.” He pauses now. “Is this right? Is this making any sense?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I’m not supposed to speak, but nodding seems like not enough. “Yeah. Yeah. This is good.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“So,” Tethi goes on, settling in. “He got a printer. He did thousands of bills and marked them with his thumbprint. There was a little inflationary crisis, but along the way it became a full-blown local currency. People used it — how do I put this. For the extra sparkle of social cohesion, like <i>my friend I am buying this from you specifically</i>. And the currency exchange downtown had a going rate! For years! Eventually the <i>hotel de ville</i> took over the supply, and it caused this mix-up with the federal government. But it stuck around to the point where he was in graduate school in Lagos and these loaded, these Nigerian guys from these big families would say,<i> we learned about your money in school, </i>and they’d take him out, I mean, I’m talking bottle service, private jets, and all they wanted was for him to grease their palms with a little Andre!”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I’m struggling to maintain eye contact. I dunno if I expect to see any debris transfer, like I told him we would. But he has me in stitches.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“He returned to Gabon to work for the national government. And of course he helped plan the transition from the franc to the eco. And I think it — I wonder all the time, whether it was a coincidence that when Suowei came in with their own plan, they came to <i>him</i>. Because years later, when the Gabonese Fork had clearly failed, even...” And his laugh takes a bitter left turn here. “Even when there was a fucking mob outside his building, for his own skull, he still believed in what they wanted to do. He’d point to this framed hundred-Andre bill and he said, Tethi, <i>transitions take time.</i>” His voice cracks. His face falls all at once. “When it all went wrong, when he — I always wanted to know, did Suowei know who they had chosen? When I came to Shanghai I went to the Suowei Tower. I wanted to ask, did they at least know the story?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This last part comes through tears. But for a long count of five I hold steady eye contact, washed over by the thickening chatter of Sieve debris. I feel the edges of his grief. I take the measure of its callouses and grooves. Not raw, not even painful, really — I press into it, letting my own eyes water — just deep and inextricable. I suppress the worst possible thought: that this is working, that this could be good data. <i>Five.</i> I offer him a squashed pack of tissues from my backpack, and then an awkward, terribly uncertain hug. Before it feels quite right to let go, he casts off the grief and the readonly net in one fluid motion.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In the recording from our session, our Sunflower Sieve debris conforms to two complementary and interlocking shapes, its bizarre vocabulary of shapes looking heliotropic, neutrally buoyant, bobbing in an emotional carrier wave. I feel the debris still in my mind reach for the screen, and remember to look obliquely. “It is...really something.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“This might be enough to bring to Deng. It directly contradict one of her old results. She should see this.” Oh, yeah, and she should look me in the eye and explain what that sunflower patch is.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“No. It’s not. I want to see it at larger scale.”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He glances back towards a monitor. A golden lattice still scaffolds the background of the Mirror Sea, and it’s impossible, especially now, for us not to see that it’s made of the same shapes. Once in a while a wild Ripple will encounter a fissure and wrap spiral-wise around it, appearing to delight in how the debris pokes and prods right back. What’s left unsaid is that Tethi has motives of his own, something to prove. He’s already got schematics and wiring diagrams, it turns out. Elaborations on a late-night throwaway idea. He lets me peruse a long list of materials. “Can you get all of this from YINS?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I thought you said this would be absolutely impossible?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I thought again.” His hand sweeps the clutter of his desk and finds something a little like sunglasses. He lets me examine them. “Do you know what these are?”</p>\n</section>",

            "content_html": "<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tethi talks about the Chalk in terms of tides. I already knew about the way it pulls people in — I’d heard less about the symmetrical way it pushes people out, sometimes just as violently, sometimes after taking years. I have to take him at his word that the triple points are the shallows: where you go in, where you come out. He says the locals from adjacent wards even come to their night market. You tend to imagine Chalkers living hand-to-mouth on stolen mangoes and penicillin. But you also hear of hospitals and riverbed submarines. Stories of the eerie effortlessness with which they feed and clothe the all-comers who fall through the cracks beneath the cracks. That takes money, which takes hustlers slumming it at the event horizon, like Tethi and Min.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I find Triple Point even spookier in the daytime: the black tarps everywhere, the stale and humid air, the last of the cicadas. For all the abandoned businesses, there is motion on the fringes of everything. Chalkers have ways of being seen only in the periphery, in vague generalities, after the fact. Sometimes I’ll get inside Old New Prosperity before an accumulation of sights and sounds and smells crashes over me: the street had been bustling, practically thronged, with people. I try to stitch these impressions along their usual edges, to recall who or what I had seen out there. But they fit together in a different way than usual. They fit together along grooves made of coincidence and repetition and correlation and —</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The chime of Min’s door dispels this dark, warm, and wavy undercurrent, and brings me back into frame. I already can’t remember it, and surely<i> that</i> should at least be familiar? But no: loop-lock memories are gaseous and diffuse, trappable in tiny pockets. This is liquid, heavy, swirling down the drain. It was not a visual or audible sensation. It was certainly not a smell. But for a moment it took everything I had to give.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Your <i>face!</i>” Tethi is laughing, but as though to draw me into the joke, to make it funny instead of scary. “Don’t let it build up like that. And anyway, it won’t last long indoors.” Lips pursed, clearly reluctant to lay bare any mechanics: “Out of view of the cameras.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Indeed, the only Chalkers I ever really encounter are the ones who come into Min’s shop. Their errands bring them careening in with purposes they can no longer name or articulate. She makes them dry off in a little nook, where scalding tea and sweet cakes help snap them into their own senses. Then she primly reminds them that she sells cable and cameras, <i>sell</i> being the operative word. Others don’t cooperate: they burst in and stride up to the counter in perfect unison and demand things in a language not even Tethi can understand. They give off the horrible sense that, behind their onyx-dark Contecs, something alien watches us through their parallax. One of two things will happen here: Tethi will jump the counter, brandish a buzz baton, insist they leave. Or Min will invite them to stay.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It’s only when she offers me a bunk of my own that I realize just how many people are staying in the back of the store. Many are on their way out of the Chalk: I can tell by the convalescent half-glaze of their gazes, the introductions that mix up <i>I </i>and <i>you.</i> But more and more, they’re on their way way in. There are the runners-from, fleeing raw losses or deep debts and seeking only obliteration. Then there are the runners-to, jaundiced with screen-lust, feverish with desire for the real Sea, marshaling the courage to take those last few steps. They linger, for a night, or a week or — I’m beginning to piece Tethi’s story together, despite his best efforts — in one case a year, becoming useful, never quite getting around to leaving. Min offers what she can to all of them without judgement. And it doesn’t appear to strike her as strange in the least, when I show up again and again, at gradually odder hours, always with bags of goods pilfered from the YINS Neikotic Engineering floors.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">I like Min. She never says much, but I like the incense she burns, the meticulous way she dusts, the cable bouquets she makes out of some compulsion. I like watching her and Tethi exchange their quiet affection. But I wonder about her.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">One night she turns to me and raises an eyebrow. “Watch the counter?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She pulls on a coat and leaves. When, exactly, did <i>this</i> happen? Maybe it was last night, when she pulled us out of Tethi’s room, away from our little assembly line, and served us heaping portions of fish soaked with lemon and ginger. Maybe it was the day before that, when I helped them gut a busted trash collector to extract one pricey little coil. Or the day before that, when Min and Tethi together listed twelve songs containing the word <i>California</i> — in English, Mando, and Korean all three, as my face went darker and darker red. It has been…exactly how many days?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">All I know is I don’t mind it here. It’s quiet in a way that YINS can never manage, its walls always humming with current and coolant. The Chalkers largely hold the Sea in their hearts, in deep wells of quadratic belief, and there are relatively few Mirror Sea displays around Triple Point. The lack of jump scares on those screens is relief I didn’t know I needed. The work we’re doing is grueling, yeah. My fingers are burnt with hot plastic and solder and the shock of stray couplings. Tethi is a maestro; there are layers and layers to even simple neikotic devices that I will never again take for granted. He would do well at YINS — no, he <i>will</i> do well. Only he may have to convince me to go back with him.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But I can’t stay forever, and the reminder comes in the form of three Chalkers who burst through the door, late past sundown. That tends to mean trouble, and I grip the worn yellow handle of the buzz baton under the counter, completely unsure if I’m capable of using it. They stride up to the counter in their face paint and rags and —</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Did you fix it?” The smallest of them shouts past my shoulder to Tethi.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And with that, a certain illusion dissipates. These are young teenagers, barely past the age where the Weather Bureau stops trying to snatch you back out of the Chalk, reasoning that you’re old enough to make your choice.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I thought you guys weren’t coming back,” Tethi tells them, overly morose. “I traded it for a pallet of teleromase smoothies.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“We <i>said</i> we were coming back,” says the small one. As he dries off I clock that his Mandarin comes with a thick North Korean accent.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“We got caught up moving a choir-bubble south-ways,” insists the tall one. She sounds Nigerian, reed-skinny but already taller than Tethi. “Tough wards. Hard to know where you’re going once you’re in it. You know how it is.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You <i>know</i> how it is,” agrees the small one.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tethi blinks once and then breaks into a shit-eating grin. “I am just fucking with you guys. Of course I fixed it.” He leads them to the second storeroom and pulls a clamshell case off a high shelf with a grunt. “Refilled the fog, too.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I lean in the doorframe, highly amused, as pulls a children’s quasigram projector, a rubbery green spherical thing, from its foam lining. <i>“OUR SOLAR SYSTEM,” </i>booms the speaker, when he flicks the switch.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I’ve <i>seen</i> this one,” the small one complains. He flips through some presets:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“<i>THE MILKY WAY GALAXY —”</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>“THE AMAZON RAINFOREST —”</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>“THE GOBI DESERT —”</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>“THE PACIFIC REEF BUILDERS —”</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>“THE MIRROR SEA OF SHANGHAI —”</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You guys,” Tethi insists. “Why don’t you watch something else for once.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So two of them try slingshotting probes around the sun. The third one — well, I can’t precisely pin him down. That particular Chalker here-nor-thereness hasn’t worn off since he stepped out of the cameras, and he says nothing, reacts to little. Soon Tethi pulls him aside, down the hall, into his own room. He shoots me a look, and then another one, and only then do I understand he means me to follow. When the young Chalker is seated in his office chair, he asks, “you didn’t come for the projector, did you?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Chalker boy tries to speak and produces only round little whispers. Tethi offers him various little stimulations: a piece of chocolate, a stress ball, and eventually, reluctantly, a bright white LED to the eyes. “Are you in there? Do you have your name?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It’s Liu Jun,” he finally replies, with the knife-edge of a question. He goes on, low and hoarse. “They want to be <i>here</i>, that’s all I know. Even when I’m hours off the street, even when I’m all the way across the...” He equivocates, I can tell between <i>city</i> and <i>Sea</i>, “I feel them tugging me this way. Even so close, they only tug harder. They’re coming in numbers. I think they’re waiting for something, something that hasn’t happened in a long time. <i>Please</i>, Tethi Okeme. You told me the story of Mo Du and the Map of the Map. You showed me how to read the Signs That Still Remain, how to See The Same Thing Twice.” He grasps for Tethi’s sleeve. “You must know something?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tethi’s low sigh is an elegy; his forehead arches in monument to a life no longer recalled. He lets the question fade, and then makes himself sound reassuring, like a good clinician. “You should stay here, just for a few days, until they clear out. Min can find you a bunk. <i>Remember yourself,</i> Liu.” But the hour passes, and Liu leaves with all the rest, looking back apologetically as the door chimes shut.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“What does this mean?” I share a long, grim look with Tethi. Suddenly, unexpectedly, I miss Yao.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It means we’re going to need more headsets.”</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">I stay very late that night. The hours run together, the way things at Triple Point tend to do. I’m still soldering well past midnight. My tongue is between my teeth, my hand steady, running liquid metal over tiny pins.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You’re going to need a CV,” I say too loudly, too suddenly. “For YINS.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tethi nods approvingly at my soldering work. Hands me the next board in exchange. “What?” He processes this a moment later. “Oh, very true. Thanks.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You’re going to need to account for the years,” I go on, head in the fumes again. “You say you’re not a Chalker. Fine. I believe you. But just how much time have you spent in there?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He flicks a switch and the visor-screen in his hands goes dark. He turns the music down, hears Min puttering around just outside, and then turns it up even louder. “I don’t like talking about it.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I understand.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I <i>can’t</i> talk about it. It is categorically and precisely not possible to talk about.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“If this is going to work, I need more than that.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He knows I’m right. He scoots his chair, cracks his knuckles. “I told you why I came to Shanghai?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Yeah,” I reply softy. I mean, only kind of. Only in broad strokes, through tears. His father was one of the architects of the Gabonese Fork, and Tethi fled for his life. The details fill themselves in, and they aren’t pretty.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I wanted to train as a neikonaut. And I was stupid enough to think that Suowei owed me something. That they’d have a clue in the world who I was. None of that worked out.” He holds up a freshly assembled headset now. “This. There’s a reason this came to mind. <i>This</i> was the work I was able to find, selling rave gizmos outside clubs and parties. People would fuck with you. Mostly they were harmless, but out there you’re always on someone else’s turf. One night, I stepped on the wrong toes. They took my pushcart and left me in a very bad state. Left me to die.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I stow the soldering iron.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“The thing is,” Tethi goes on, “I had no home ward. And when you have no ward alignment — you know which hospitals are going to treat you? Without a fuss, without getting the bluelights involved? Chalker hospitals. They peeled me off the ground. I recovered, and then made myself useful. I...<i>god. </i>I wish I could put it into words, I really do. Five floors and a thousand eyes. The way the wind blew through the whole building at once, how that felt...” He falls silent, looking happy about something distant. It makes me glad to see him like this. “People like to say the Chalk steals people, so as not to admit that their friend or their kin made the choice. You always make the choice.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I press. “And you make the choice to leave?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Well, Min took me in.” He pauses. This percolates. “Listen, I get it. If I found a mind-spanning megastructure with a twin in the Mirror Sea...” Tethi waves his arms expansively. “If I saw the Ripples were building something, I wouldn’t go to YINS for answers. I’d go to a Chalker.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Teth...”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“<i>But I am choosing to leave this place.</i>” He enunciates every syllable, sliding it under the music. “I need YINS to take me seriously, and that starts with you. Can you do that?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Can <i>Deng</i> do that? I’ve batted this question back and forth every night, trying to sleep. In some of my little hypnagogic puppet shows, she welcomes Tethi with open arms. <i>At last,</i> she implies, <i>a student worthy of my brilliance</i>. Other times, I’m the cat and he’s what I dragged in. Mostly I turn that patch over and over in my hands, and I sit with the fact that there’s something I’m missing.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Mona? Can you?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Yes. Yes. Of course I can.”</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">It’s earnestly chilly when I finally head out just a few hours before dawn. I pull my jacket on, turn my collar up against the wind that makes its way up the block. It plays the tarps and tents of Triple Point, heavy flapping and low whistles. <i>There’s something going on in there.</i> The thought is harmlessly vague against the logistics of getting home. <i>There are people going in there.</i> Lone men, whole families, with their pushcarts and shopping bags. My blood runs dense and hot, watching them turn that gentle bend into the heart of Triple Point. Tethi did mention something about a night market.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Chalkers have what people need: vegetables and painkillers and brake pads. They have what people want, too: hot youtiao and lily-waft perfumes and little cartridges with three hundred hits of 4-AcO-MET. But much of what they have is not so easy to judge as vitamin or vice, necessity or nicety. You won’t know in the moment, or for many months, why it drew your eye, why it was pressed into your hand. Your money is no good in there; you just need to be brave enough to step inside. I scan the faces that pass me, inscrutable in the dark. I wonder how many are looking for a totemic seedling of a new life, and how many just need to eat.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And when I’m brave enough to step inside, sensation accumulates. Hot oil and and ripe fruit and pungent betel-nut linger long past the stimulus, myelinating the walls of my mind. No chatter, no laughter, no barter. Precious little light: of tiny, scrolling, monochrome displays, of blue-gas burners, of waxing moonglint on waxy mangoes. The lack is lucid. The mind finally free to consider rustling plastic, cool wind, the hundred different smells of shoes. No deliberation, no thinking twice. Decision, purchase, exchange, all made with loaded glance and portent gesture, objects simply taken, offered, swapped sight unseen in newspaper and twine. These thicken and blur into currents of exchange striated with desire and preference and ability and need, but whose? Just <i>whose</i>?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Above me, those red pinpricks, rubytears of blind eyes, the hum of the joy of uncountable new constellations, finally, a sky willing to watch back...</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It takes on all the richness I let it. Glints spicedense and cherrydeep, abundance offered from all to all, wretched twice-salvaged toys, dice, rice, stationery, batteries, genzhe globes, a bewildering array of ferrous powders, the abstraction and extrusion of treasure, the glint of possibility and synchronicity, the bellyfelt goldmelt annealing of need and have into unfurling, expansion, pure motile force, the deep assurance that there is enough, so take, and give, and take again, don’t be so bashful of what you are, for even the stars are the raw fact of consumption, and there’s no need to look down upon the stars.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Above me the near-full moon, its distance lonestrange face humming and golden, its tendrils expanding over the fundamental, rich, warm, darkness of —<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">No, over this <i>street</i>, over the rustle of the ginkgos! Over the aftertastes in my mouth, over the weight in my hands! Over the sudden terror of trying to balance on two legs! And I am out the other side, turning over the intricate coincidence in my hands, the abstract way-thing, the color-flush hyperobject in this plastic shopping bag, the mingled relief and loss as I forget what I was meant to do with it, as it resolves into constituent pedestrian parts, into scissors and shave-gel and amphetamine drink-mix, and marble-sized prime-numbered voxelite buddhas, and a nearly intact conch shell, and a do-it-yourself dental kit. And a thumb drive labeled <i>Summer Vacation. </i>And six colors of felt-tip pen. And hundreds of Thai bhat in loose, jangling coins. And chamomile tea.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I take it all home. I can’t bring myself to throw it away.</p>\n</section>",

            "content_html": "<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You gotta put the emphasis on the first syllable. Listen. <i>In</i>-tro-speeeecs!” Tethi cups his hands, and his voice carries over the crowd loosely milling around one of the unknowably many entrances to Wu Ke Nai He. This little segment of it, on the northeast corner of a sprawling twelve blocks, Baidu Maps still thinks is a warehouse full of vacuum parts.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“No. C’mon. You sound like you’re selling hot dogs at a baseball game. In Mandarin, you gotta get a patter going. Take everything we have and string it all together, a little too fast.” Then, bringing my voice up into my nose: “Genzhe globes — Introspecs — Flower crowns — Quasi wands — Genzhe globes...” I rifle through our pushcart, layers of cheap plastic treasures pilfered from Min’s storeroom. “Christ, what else do we have in here?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He gives me the stink eye. “Hey, who’s done this before?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It was utterly endearing, the way he had it all ready to go when I arrived at Triple Point for the last time: the pushcart, the sorted piles of rave paraphernalia, a forged vendor’s permit to boot. Min was doing laoban shit up front, <span class=\"s1\">wiping the counter, blowing dust off ancient clamshell casings. She shoved mooncakes into our mouths.</span> Hands on her hips, overtly skeptical, she regarded Tethi’s <span class=\"s1\">pushcart like a long-forgotten toy.</span> “So <i>this</i> is how you’re spending the Mid-Autumn Festival? Why not just enjoy things, Teth? Why be like this?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It’s fish in a barrel, <i>Min ayi</i>. We need the money.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She harrumphed. “No, good! Go, go on, take it out. <span class=\"s1\">It’s an awful waste of space and it doesn’t sell here.</span>” Then, turning to me with a sly smile: “This is how they found him, you know. Selling this absolute junk on the streets.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Something passed between them then, broadband and narrowbeam, that I wasn’t privy to. Surely she had questions about Tethi’s backpack, big enough to live out of for some indefinite future. But they kept up the charade ’til he was outside. Then he turned on his heel, just as the door chimed open, and they embraced in the warm light of the shopfront. I saw him press a hard wallet into her hand, and her return it firmly. I watched from under the concrete as he wiped away her tears, held back his own. <i>I will, I will, </i>I thought I heard him say.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We walked our pushcart, mostly in silence, towards the center of Triple Point. Tethi kept setting his face straight, I kept not noticing how his lips wobbled at the edges. Wu Ke Nai He was where the Chalkers first peeled him off the sidewalk: he didn’t have to tell me, and I didn’t ask. But that was the shadow of his insistence that the venue’s Mid-Autumn parties were the stuff of legend. That I’d understand once inside why this had to be the place.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“<i>In</i>-tro-speeeecs!”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Oh, yeah, Introspecs: </span><span class=\"s3\">what might be sunglasses, every edge a curve, a hi-res screen conjoining the outer lenses. The stems have very simple UTMS sensors, used to divine the wearer’s emotion and splash it in color across their eyes. They were red-hot a few years ago, and Min had accumulated hundreds of pairs. We spent a hellish, weird, wonderful week cracking open as many as we could and rewiring them into Sunflower Sieve debris detectors. Now we’re each wearing a pair, showing swirls of yellows and greens, shouting our voices hoarse to be heard.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">The crowd thickens, the bass beckons, but it’s clear by how well-lit this corner is that we’ve set up too from the venue. Genzhe globes in luminous red and lunar gold and bob just overhead, halfheartedly chasing their owners through a ramble of midair calligraphy and quasigraphic rabbit hunts and mournfully melodic diziphone showdowns. We sell more flower crowns than Introspecs, with plenty of downtime for boats of thick, spicy noodles and another round of mooncakes. Fudan University’s Ripple-dance team appears beneath an enormous sheet: undulating down the lane with elsewhere’s choreography, raking in tips via QR codes flashed along their shared surface between acts. Afterwards, two of them approach us for Introspecs. Tethi hesitates — we need to be selling these to neikonauts — but he relents when one of them opens a hard wallet with a <i>ka-click </i>worth more than my life.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">“Four hundred for the both,” he decides. And will they notice how heavy they are, crammed with radios and extra sensors? They will not. They’re clearly on something. Listing colors to each other, running out of obvious ones, delighting in this. Tethi’s obsequious grin turns to an obscene grimace the moment he wheels away. “<i>Fuck</i>. <i>Sa mère la pute.”</i> And so on and so forth, making a slashing note on his spreadsheet, marking even more customers as <i>not a neikonaut.</i> “We need to get in closer. This is the wrong crowd to be selling to here.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">“You’re on edge. The main act isn’t on for like three hours.” But I don’t protest as he wheels the cart up the lane until we cross the chain-link fence, where our wares glow in a deeper dark. Tethi <i>is</i> on edge. I sense him daring the Chalkers who run this place to come give us a hard time, but why? Does he want a fight? A way back in? Are those just the same thing? They come upon us three to a whirlwind, inscribing tight circles around us, their black garb revealed as nothing but latex spray. A similar gloss of white on their faces, over their lips, into their nostrils, shorn even of eyelashes. They’re practically vacuum-sealed in there, for chrissakes, locked into wide-eyed grins of visceral satisfaction. Converging in front of us and asking with terrifying, matte-black stares, <i>what gives?</i> Tethi meets their contortions with his own, and when the Chalkers drift away, I realize he hasn’t blinked for a full minute.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">“So we can stay here?” I whisper, duly impressed.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">He wrinkles his nose, glad that he can. “Until the next ones come by.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">We manage to get many of the Introspecs onto the faces of neikonauts. The other junk sells slowly, overlooked for the oversized, glowing sunflowers offered by other pushcarts. We offload our wares to them for a song.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Behind piles of corrugated rust we transform into patrons of Wu Ke Nai He. We peek, delighted, at Tethi’s rollscroll, at the readouts lighting up with Sieve debris. This gets unrolled and taped inside Tethi’s jacket; the RF receiver gets taped far enough up my leg to justify a slap. When he’s not looking, I also tape an autovial there; hey, it’s a club.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">For hours, we’ve watched the capillaries of the metro deposit thousands of people in line before us. It folds into switchbacks, sprouts tributaries. Veetles impending with deadly heat from above have nowhere to land. “We could just stay outside,” I offer, snapping my gum discontentedly. “They won’t go out of range.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">He gives me a look: <i>you don’t mean that and you know it.</i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">The line spills into neighboring Luxing Ward, whose redlights are nineteen and pimple-faced and undersized for their mall-cop getups. Their glo-wand waving has zero effect on the flow of traffic. They snarl at Wu Ke’s Chalkers, who gaze placidly back. Then they call the real cops. A hefty Blue Delta veetle finds purchase. Bluelights spill out, unhappy to be here, channeling rump authority with more glo-wands. More Chalkers, too. In their acute glances, clockweb and spiderwork, something spectral rears its head at a hundred twenty bpm.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">All the while dying to check Tethi’s rollscroll again.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">A reveler breaks out of line. To whoops and cheers, she tries directing traffic with glo-wands we sold her.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">All the while imagining how to relay this to Deng. <i>It’s a rave, but you wouldn’t call it that, you’d call it a “party”...</i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Entry is by way of double velvet curtains, operated airlock-style by ghostly white hands. Immediately, bass subsumes all. Teth and I get one last glance, and then we’re split, by a black velvet wedge, into two security lines. The attendant patting me takes the autovial for granted, and completely misses the RF receiver. “Your gum,” he drones, gesturing hand-it-over.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">“My <i>gum</i>? For real?” Suddenly I’m prepared to blow the whole operation over half a pack of Mint San Wei.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">“We’re the Weather Bureau,” his buddy insists. He has knifepoint sigil-scars wreathing his eyes and a lollipop in his cheek. “And the Bureau needs your gum.” With a cherry-stained smirk he counts out three sticks for each of them, and hands me two back. But I’m in. All hints of geometry or scale are subsumed by matte black. Hesitant, diagonal steps, cutting sideways through the pressure, until I round another velvet wall.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">On the other side are the Ripples.</span></p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">They rise in soft, vague columns of quasigraphic light. They slicker rectilinearly along silkscreen mazes, lurking in foggy saddle-points, feeding via interference. No scarce and wispy tendrils, either. These are prime cuts, enough geometry to make sense of a Ripple as a whole. Cheetah-space phase-field rings, chains of polygon shatter, peeling and selfsame cactus-blooms: adequate description of these patterns would come with a strobe warning, but <i>bright</i> white, colorbled at the fringes. And on beat with the music, with its smeared echoes, fed by directly by steel columns of silver teardrops, infrared rings the color of nothing, packing the ceiling, packing the walls, blooming from table centerpieces. We move to the beat and the Ripples move in response, closing the loop from camera to screen to camera, feedback loops riding the ceiling, teasing the exponential. A loose, juicy wave passes behind my eyes and suddenly I’m lost, profoundly lost, in the crowd. My vision goes wide — I only need eyes to see that <i>here</i> is <i>there</i>, I don’t even have to pretend...</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“Mona!” Tethi’s voice narrows it way down. His hand finds an arm, leads its owner off the ground and around a circular velvet outcrop. I swear it takes a revolution and a half to get to the bathrooms. He leans me <i>(oh — me)</i> against a wall. “Are you going to be all right in here?”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“I just didn’t...” says something called Mona, a lost love, a favorite flavor. “It’s a bit more than I expected.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“Yeah. That’s what people say.” Sympathy from a distance. For Tethi, this place is a crude condensation, even a parody, of a deeper and more fulsome relationship with the Ripples. But Wu Ke earns its sheen of danger. People hear <i>it’s where the Ripples bring us to dance</i>, and realize it’s true. The quadratically inclined disappear the same night.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We flatten the rollscroll on a high-top, brightness down, sipping uppers and lime. Our mesh network of headsets, all triangulating each others’ locations, has long since thinned into the crowd. The music feeds thumping correlations in their debris. The readouts are choppy things, sixteen pixels to a side, but another layer of software weaves them together into something like Yao’s model. If it’s right — if any of this is real — then this is the Ripples’ sunflower structure we’ve found in their minds. And we are very, very near the center.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“Yo,” Tethi whispers. We’ve been getting glances, and he sounds even more on edge now. “Numbers eighteen and nineteen.” And the debris from those headsets looks very weak. Maybe the batteries are dying —</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“Oh. <i>Oh.</i> They were the Ripple-dancers, Tethi, <i>those weren’t neikonauts!</i>”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“There must be something wrong with the Introspecs.” His face falls and falls as he flips through the readouts. We sold dozens of headsets to people without neikotic channels, and wrote them off as a bust, and now practically every one of them is lighting up with Sieve debris. “It’s just not possible. You would know, Mona, you’re the expert.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">My mouth tightens at the edges. “I’ve never heard of it happening. I don’t know how exactly it would work.” But now the rhythm and the lasers and the fog all fade away as I consider the question. Even at the psychosis-worn fringes of the literature, there’s nothing about neikotic debris sliding through crowds on glance and gesture. But if it were happening, if it <i>were</i> possible…it would begin here. It would be nothing more than a bad pattern that flashes, almost randomly, through the Mirror Sea — a pattern that grabs drug-addled, laser-blinded minds, apertures jammed open, and doesn’t let go. Quadratic belief would reinforce it in mind after mind, until it infects the motion of the crowd and gets picked up on the cameras, and now it’s there again, reinforcing itself, weaving into and out of the Sea. It would have to be miraculously, meticulously engineered. It would only have to happen once.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And what is my reward for believing in it? Thick, golden ribbons of debris revealed in their full brightness, poked and prodded by wild Ripples, delighting in the how prods back, diffusing its scrambling alphabet of shapes into the murk. This picked up subconsciously by the crowd, played back by the trance floor in syncopated clicks and whirs, reappearing in the patterns seen by the Mirror Sea, floaters in dragonfly eyes. </span><span class=\"s2\"><i>What’s happening out there is happening in here. </i>The implications are obscure but nooselike, with the acrid smell of unhappy coincidence, the foreclosure of possibility into claustrophobic grooves. <i>The loop is closing, tightening.</i> The more we look, the more we’ll see. And the more we see, the closer we’ll look. I</span><span class=\"s1\">f all of these people, regular people, are carrying traces of Sieve debris, what could the Ripples make us see? What could they make us do?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It is, upon some reflection, hardly stranger than loop-lock. Once a neikonaut establishes contact with a scanner, it does shockingly little. Its magnets reach barely a centimeter past the cranium, just into the magnetic pockets of consciousness on the surface of the brain, and then only to gently reinforce a connection borne almost entirely on sight and correlation: root-level, bone-dry faith shared by you and the computer, that each knows what the other will do next. <i>It loops because it loops, rises because it rises.</i> And here we are, Mona and Tethi — or maybe Xu and Okeme, in the vein of Lam and Waldmann or Deng and Rui, a collaboration for the ages. The Ripples are not careful scientists, but they are, in the end, scientists all the same. Do they know that we are too? Do they know that we’re here at all?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>“I’m going in there,”</i> I shout, directly into Tethi’s ear.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">His eyes widen and then narrow as he realizes what I’m saying. <i>“What on earth for?”</i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Yeah, Mona, what for? Is it a researcher’s curiosity, instrumental, mechanical, cool to the touch? A clinician’s concern, warm and lemon-scented, spring-loaded, oath-bound to meet the moment? Maybe it’s something that glows hot and mindless in the dark, a connoisseur’s sick delight, to be sampled only under Wu Ke Nai He’s velvet veil? It’s all of this, intermingled, indistinguishable. I can help, but first and foremost, I <i>need</i> to know. And not to justify or explain that need — and that’s the condition, it’s always been the condition, since I first dusted off the Deng Bridge. An unexpected conviction passes through me: she, of all people, will understand.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>“Science,” </i>I shout back, as the whump-whump of the bass flattens into a sustained and ominous drone. “Or something. Are you coming or what?”</span></p>\n</section>",

            "content_html": "<section>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The thick of the crowd gives me a choice: tendrils or elbows. I can just look <i>up</i> at the Ripples and lose myself completely. That’s what everyone’s here to do: Chalker, chaser, neikonaut. Flower crowns, quasi-wands, LED-glow sunflowers raised in saucer-eyed ecstasy. Or I can keep my eyes below meridian, focus on human bodies, on arms and butts and pheromones, looking at <i>you </i>and <i>you </i>and <i>you</i> and <i>sorry, excuse me</i>, pushing through a great collective trance, seeing the wave for its particles. It becomes apparent that there are so many goddamn rooms in this place. Warehouse-sized, closet-sized, the music interpolates seamlessly between all of them.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>I measure out an upward glance: the Ripples jelly-pulse, whip-shimmer, spiral-bounce. And for all their blind jostling, their flashes of destructive interference, they move far more easily than we do. They brush by so fluidly, that it’s easy to believe that they’re leading the dance.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">By and large, they’re moving in the same direction we are.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Tethi stows the rollscroll after one last look. There is a clear center to things, a cluster of Introspecs where the debris readouts are so powerful they’ve started feeding static into the sensors. And there are deep veins of it to traverse along the way, where the speakers in the floor resonate with curlicue come-hither whoops, and where the faint light of the quasigrams seems a little more golden. There are people whose glances are barbed with it, whose motions draw in attention and send jagged skewers of reaction back through the crowd. I recognize one of them from my photonics seminar, and I’m very glad she doesn’t recognize me, especially not now. <i>One hit. Just to get your bearings.</i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>I flex my wrist, and my wanji sends a spike of DMT crashing through the autovial on my thigh. Instantly the characteristic E-flat buzz of the come-up, waves of sickly yellow and green flashing before my eyes, a sudden and elaborate gnosis. It bounces through my neikotic channels, coating them with sticky, staticky little tile-cules of Sieve debris. For the length of a terrible spasm, I have hundreds of limbs, thousands of fingers, my whole being a cartography of the Ripples’ designs on the Sea. I point, and mouth the words, but it’s so loud don’t even bother to shout: <i>This way!</i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And as Sieve debris builds up inside me, I feel tentative tugs of Ripples. Wild ones from nameless ravines, who know nothing of gemstone towers or razor-straight sluices of light. I feel them as obscure and igneous sorrows, mantle-hot, mantle-deep. The debris <i>sticks</i> to them. It yields to their clumsy, fluvial manipulations like clay, and it prickles their own contours back to them. Waves of bubble-wrap multiocularity rise and fall as they recognize their own reflections, the very concept of a reflection, and ask: <i>if this is me, then what am I?</i> Would that I could describe the way it feels to be on both sides of the mirror at once.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>“We’re close,”</i> Tethi shouts. He shows me on his wanji how many minutes to moonrise.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At this I begin to lose track of the where and when of things. I flex again, and this time the spike is of purples and purples and <i>purples</i>, but also deep reds and rich browns, like the loam underfoot. I sway in a wind from all directions at once, elbowing and apologizing my way inwards, making contact here with a shoulder and there with a wide, green leaf, hear a shout of protest and turn to see the wide, black face of a sunflower blinking at me, beady seedy eyes each one unseeing but their sum total uncomfortably like the gaze that oh, after all, is from the holder of the beverage I just spilled with a stray swipe...</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>“Here,” </i>I read from Tethi’s lips. He brandishes his own wanji and flexes it, hard. <i>“Now.”</i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It might be several minutes later, for all I know, or it might be right on his cue: as the harvest moon rises above Shanghai, it plays on the facets of untold millions of cameras, and floods the Sea with brilliant golden light. It rises from tiny whirlpools of whirlpools — and these now collected by the coprocessors into a single, enormously spherical <i>thing</i> lurking just below the surface, throwing the spires and grottos around it into jagged relief, and if the Ripples outside cannot see it they surely pause dumbstruck in its warmth. The collected light twinkles and chimes off the ribbons of Sieve debris, sending pixelated, panchromatic flashes into our collected eyes. In the <i>oohs</i> and <i>ahhs</i> around me, I catch low murmurs of fearful recognition from neikonauts. Already some are trying to escape. These are primer tiles.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Something is knocking at our door in the language of loop-lock.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Tethi and I share one last glance, and we face it back to back. And now the Sea crashes undammed onto my head, acceleration to terminal velocity to quadratic offset. An eyeful of salt water of hyperlagmites of sigils. <i>AN EYEFUL OF EYES</i>.<i> AN EYE FULL OF EYES.</i> Tiles flashing faster than I’ve ever seen before, four then sixteen then two million in a single blink. The first few moments have that usual loop-lock feel of quantization and jitter, the closures wrapping my thoughts nesting in elegant tiers, a frosted-glass relief map of my own soul. Only I don’t feel boundaries where I normally do, I feel wide channels, a blurring of edges, a closing of seams. The tiles claw into my vision, turning the world blue and green and yellow.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>“Hey,” </i>I shout to him as our world dissolves.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>“Hey what?” </i>He roars back, almost losing his balance.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The glimpse was just that. The thought is absurd. But wasn’t that her, just now, just over there?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>“I think I just saw my advisor.”</i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I blink, eyes salty with sweat, in a staring contest with an endless field of sunflowers.</span></p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">She — <i>she</i> had been here! But the lapse is momentary. <i>Who</i>, Mona?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The heat must be getting to me. How many hours have I been chasing the sun through these wildflowers?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>It’s absurd enough that this was my plan, more absurd still that for a long time, it appeared to work. What kind of stars, what kind of moon, will be here to light my path when my legs finally falter and the sun sets? It’s a risk I can’t afford to take, so I’ve been trudging steadily west, jogging in bursts, and keeping that sun above me. If that’s what it really is. I hear it throwing off low rumbles and wind chime harmonics, and I find I can stare at it without pain, even strain my eyes to unpack its bright white into fine swirls of gold. But whenever I look back up, it seems to have moved much further west, so for now I keep it in the corner of my mind.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Instead I focus on the sunflowers and, in their own way, they focus on me. Each has at its center a thousand tiny onyx eyelets which form a large compound eye, with such hazy perception that you may stand in front of one for the span of ten breaths and make no more than the slightest smudge on its world. But plant them together and their roots tangle and intersect, sharing and elaborating on the same great image until they not only see you, but seem to anticipate you. I crane my neck backwards now: in the uncountable miles of them, rising and falling on shallow hills, I can make out the gentlest trace of my presence. They have turned, too subtly to notice in the moment, to face me as I pass. Spend all day in the sunflowers and you begin to exist solely on their terms, your soul knit from grass and dew coursing through your veins, no trouble swifter than a hungry caterpillar even in the spectrum of your attention.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And spend too long away from the flowers, well, I shudder to think. I might buy a few minutes on the glance of a blackbird hanging off a reed, or by grinding my feet into the dirt to cave in an anthill, but the fabric of causality is ever-mending and ever-spooling into unseen depths. To be stitched out takes far less than I once thought: a few minutes in unobserved stillness will do it. I could rise from my reverie and find that the universe has simply moved on without me, along a simpler course through time that carries no trace of my past and leaves me no way back into the future. That such a thing has never been observed in missing socks, in hibernating raccoons, in elderly neighbors, is less than cold comfort — it is precisely the point. The truest terror is just out of our peripheral vision, on the lip of a maw too wide to see through our telescopes. Death is a smokescreen. We are right to fear it, but as the proximate cause of <i>this</i>.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And the sun is lower in the sky now, and the sunflowers can’t see in the dark.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There are others here — mere rustling disturbances in distance stalks, hints of bipedal motion. So when I finally admit that I need a break, even under this reddening sky, I come to a stream and hope against hope that someone just as thirsty as I am will be there too. Time passes so strangely here that my exhausted stumbling towards the water, collapsing on the ground, and drinking my fill, are stretched into the same rubber-band present, finally snapping loose as I dunk my head underwater for the third or fourth time. <i>You’re going to die here, Mona</i>. <i>You’re going to go unseen and slip away.</i> Already I feel the creep of other possibilities that neatly fill my little vacuum in spacetime. I see it now in the widening bell curve of faces shimmering back on the surface of the stream, my close bob lengthening and my narrow face filling out. {{Mona Xu,}} I say out loud, trying to remember what it’s worth. No one is around to care.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Only...there is someone.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">{{You’re not her,}} comes a high, crisp voice behind me. A whirlwind reorientation, a twanging oscillation that sets my back foot in the stream. When I find myself again in the space between self and other, I’m butt down in the mud, and there’s a face looking up — <i>wait, no, focus, Mona</i> — down at me. A face shimmering between features, but all centered on — <i>am I doing this, or is she? </i>— centered around something familiar. She offers no hand up. If she offers any reaction at all to my fall, it’s in the upper harmonics of her sneer. I scramble to my feet, and find something that passes for a voice.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">{{Dr. Deng?}}</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">{{You’re not her,}} the Deng-thing repeats. {{Maybe she doesn’t work here anymore.}} Its tone level and assessing, stony gaze cutting clear through. And I say <i>Deng-thing</i> because it can’t be her, it just can’t, not even with that signature sigh of disappointment. Not even because she looks unstuck in time, betraying no particular age between ten years my senior or forty centuries old. She — it — steps forward and takes me by the chin with a cool, indifferent left hand. Inspects me at what feels like a molecular level. {{Ah — but you know her, don’t you? Didn’t I come so close?}}</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Frozen, remembering to move, so the sunflowers will see me. They turn to face the Deng-thing — but no, that’s not quite right. The seconds drip viscously by, and I glimpse inverted causality. She follows the flowers. They project her.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">{{Show her what I show you,}} the thing hisses. Then it slinks away, on foot or not, into the stalks.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Night crashes down in a blink. I try to follow, cursing precious minutes lost, any hydration gained now quickly sweat out. The sun falls over the horizon and disappears, revealing a swirl of stars-that-are-not. I follow a surefire gradient, a path only I would take, ripping the indifferent flowers from their stalks, reveling sickly in the idea that wanton destruction might mark me as human until sunrise. <i>{{Mona Xu, Mona Xu,}}</i> I keep muttering, but it’s a lie, a waste of breath. {{<i>I am human I am here and what would a human being do, what could I do now that a scarecrow or the wind couldn’t</i>.}} It’s no use. As the last light disappears over the horizon, the sunflowers begin to close. Unobserved, I feel myself slipping away into the breeze. My existence rests on the tensile strength of quantum foam.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I am nowhere, I am everywhere, in this infinite, idealized night. I am wind over the heads of the flowers and the dirt that feeds their roots. A null assertion of self, free of identity or desire, the color of nothing. Even that nullity competes with others, other non-faces stalking the flowers unseen — dozens of them, maybe...</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">{{She’s just trying to help,}} comes a swirl around me. Not with recognition, but with a sweet, ambient puff of acknowledgement. Another face briefly seen from down in the dirt, inviting me to conjure a name. <i>Min? Is that Min?</i> But the Min-thing floats away, only ever a thin smile and a whisper: {{The next time you see her, be kind.}}</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Utter absence forever. I am formless. And yet still, impossibly, I am here.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And then the sun begins to rise in the east.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The sunflowers are all wrong. I only ever notice myself through their lazy gaze. And that is a shattered thing now, their network of roots torn to shards. I see myself peeled off the ground, throat parched, back throbbing. But the unity of the image cannot hold. I move as a multitude, a scattered stumbling in all directions, as though between shards broken and tarnished glass. I feel pushed back by the boundaries of the root systems, struggling to push myself between them, trapped in isolated little knots, lurching forward in what is revealed as an endless loop. I reach for other-Monas and they reach out in reflected turn, but nothing can bridge the gaps between the patches of sunflowers, all seeing me from disconcerted, disconnected angles. I am a shattered thing...</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">{{Do you see what we deal with?}} The Deng-thing is all around me, its cruel features smeared across sun-kissed islands of sight. Even the breeze through the crosseyed flowers is all wrong, discontinuous eddies and swirls. {{Do you see what her cowardice did? Do you see what she left me to fix?}}</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It tilts its many chins back towards the sun — which is not a sun. No sun would have such staggering, paralyzing patters running across its surface. No sun could compel the flowers to reach for me now with their clawing, beady, gnarled sightlines, isolating me, gagging me, pinning my <i>tilespace</i> — and the concept comes with a churning shift in perspective. I can’t move my limbs because I have no limbs. I have no eyes, no head in here. I am everywhere, the sand and the sunflowers and the sky. Realization, elation: I reach for the hard circuitry at the edge of my awareness, grasping for the emergency shutdown. But at my periphery I find only more sand, more sunflowers, tessellating far beyond my grasp. I am a neikonaut, I am in loop-lock, but I don’t think I’m in a UTMS scanner. Something is wrong.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Then: another nearly formless figure, reaching a hand through the bulge in the tiles. The Deng-thing reacts, but this convexity reacts faster — it’s all familiar, the sweat on its palm, the chokingly ill-advised lavender of its cologne, the infrasonic pulse of the dance floor under my feet — and now Tethi jerks on my shoulder with conjured loops of radiant violet, a familiar and selfsame wave of pure relief —</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">{{You’re holding on,}} he shouts, and yanks me out of loop-lock. {{Let go.}}</span></p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The mantra comes as a dazzling, purple-and-white flash of inversion, a tunnel of concentric rings, a release back to the dance floor, and if that wasn’t loop-lock — and in the strictest sense, it wasn’t — it leaves me with the same dusting of technicolor grit on my soul. I catch myself in a two-step stagger cut diagonally through the confused and concerned, just as my hands hit the filthy, sticky floor. Nearby, Tethi is faring only a little better. But if we’re making a scene, so is every other neikonaut nearby. They’re going down like bowling pins, at least those that were clipped by — just what was it? It was the sparkle of moonlight on those ribbons of debris.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I pick out three kinds of crowd noise punching holes in the <i>whump-whump</i> of the trance floor. The first is a roller-coaster <i>oooh</i> and <i>ahhh</i>: the full moon is still rising from petaled whirlpools in the Sea, still infusing the brine with unbearably beautiful veins of gold. The second is from inebriated neikonauts pulled in by the primer tiles, limbs locking and seizing up, screaming as though pushed off a bridge. The third is a fleeing, chatter-scatter retreat from bright columns of xenon-white light, bobbing through the crowd. It’s all just below boiling point.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Tethi offers me an arm up, and from his wanji I learn that barely a minute has passed.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“Was that really you? In there with me?” And if so, was that really <i>Deng?</i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“We need to go.” Tethi looks eagled-eyed, scouting for a route. “Now.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It looks equally fucked in every direction, so we begin pushing away from the nearest column of light, which is attached to the hand of a Weather Bureau agent. They’re picking their way through the crowd in pairs shouting the things you’d expect, like <i>make way, give ground</i> and <i>please remain calm! </i>The one nearest us seems unsure whether to shine the light into the neikonauts’ eyes or the Mirror Sea cameras. And overhead, a flock of their camballs whirs around, each round little drone staking out its turf, hovering blue LEDs joining the fixed constellations of red. I look back to see Tethi ducking beneath his rollscroll, keeping the contours of his face out of the drones’ view. They’re not <i>doing</i> anything yet, but if they see him they’ll be on him in a second. <i>Red lights near, you’re in the clear. Lights of blue, we’re watching you…</i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He shouts a warning into my ear: “This is about to get weird.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“Oh, <i>come on. </i>What could you possibly mean?”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He means this: all around us Chalkers descend from the rafters on winches and wire, spider-silent, gargoyle-posed, invisible against the velvet walls until suddenly, they’re not. Just to our left one of them grabs a Weather Bureau woman by the shoulders. She makes an unearthly <i>whoop</i>, a scream through synthvox that dopplers back up through the quasigrams to the ceiling at spine-whipping speeds. Her lantern drops into the crowd, spreading eerie shadows across the filthy floor. And even as confusion turns to panic turns to a lopsided brawl between the Bureau and the Chalk, the trance floor is <i>still</i> trying to make sense of our footfall as halting, skeltering licks and snatches of synth and bass.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>“Please proceed in an orderly manner to the nearest marked ex —”</i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And as this next Weather Bureau agent goes leg-up to the rafters, Wu Ke Nai He teeters on the knifepoint of a deadly chaos that makes you <i>wish </i>this place had marked exits. Tethi and I are thirty meters away from anything that might be a wall, our motion random at best. Grimly I consider the value of human life through Chalker eyes: there <i>must </i>be house lights, there <i>must</i> be more ways out. But for them, this is a laboratory. This is a training ground for the wild Ripples, who need to learn to behave, to interact without destructive interference.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Can they? <i>Can we?</i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It comes from within the crowd: <i>don’t push, go slow. </i>Not a broadcast, but a whisper: <i>don’t push, go slow.</i> It comes in on locked eyes from nearest neighbors, individual strangers, I won’t if you won’t: <i>don’t push, go slow.</i> It sheds fear and desperation and becomes a rallying cry echoing through the warehouse, picked up by foot-stomp and ratified by the bassline: <i>don’t push, go slow. </i>And — unbelievably, we’ve done it — no one is pushing. We’re all moving slowly, calmly, to the exits. The Weather Bureau is still pouring in, but they’ve lost the xenon lanterns now, these are uniformed medics looking for the injured and tile-shocked…</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Don’t push, go slow.</i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">People are saying it, yes. But I wouldn’t put it in quotes. The more I look — and the more I look, the more I see it — it’s as through the message is being transmitted through the crowd. <i>Don’t push, go slow.</i> Human agency is here, but encoded, amplified, transmitted, and abstracted by something artificially sleek and brand new. It is here for us, but only indirectly, incidentally. It resonates with lower energies in me but not of me, merely learned, merely borrowed for the duration. <i>Don’t push, go slow.</i> And the more I look — something convex goes flat, some certainty drops out, and for a moment I have perfect leeway to choose. Is it us or them? At the end of the day, is it us or them? <i>Don’t push, go slow.</i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Tethi shakes this off like a drizzle. Something buzzes behind his shoulder.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>“Mona, I hate to say this, but I think we have to push.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It’s terrifying, the idea that we could break the equilibrium and turn this back into a massacre. And it’s curious, the way the crowd seems to part for us and us alone. But to be fair, we alone <i>do</i> have a drone swarm at our backs. It calls out in a fragmented chorus, a butchered transliteration of Tethi’s name, <i>stand down, stand down.</i> In a volley of whirs and clicks it unleashes pea-sized tranq pellets in our general direction, which sting and stick and squish. <i>Mbetethi Okeme, you have committed a tantamount crime against human self-determination, stand down, stand down.</i> And one of them hits my hair, and one of them hits the zipper of my dress, and one of them hits Tethi in the forearm...<i>No! You are not taking him, not after all this! </i>But he bites it off and spits it to the floor. And all around us people are going down indiscriminately, the whole scene backlit with a strange grace, its brushstrokes lingering in my eyes.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“In here.” All of a sudden I’m beneath a waterfall of black velvet and now Tethi grabs my wrist. “Hit that again.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“What? Teth, where —”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He brandishes fresh chalk. “Just trust me.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And I flex, and it hits my bloodstream immediately, the darkness around me a concentricity made of vibrating molecules of cool damp ocean of the beach just before it begins to rain. And Tethi (he is ahead of me, somehow) whips all that away and accelerates into a tunnel innervated with gemstone sconces, studded with architectural sapphire-moss outcrops that you might call balconies. At one of these he skids to a stop and gestures outward, to the great center of their lusciously chromatic city of pinnacles that ever-consume themselves with a languidly mechanical gleam, of wormways burning at their core with high summer’s hottest noon. And in the center, its quick arc-whips already powering it all, is the bulbous core of the Sunflower Sieve. Its sheer brightness puts swarms of Ripples into ecstatic silhouette. To look directly into it is to see all brought down on low heat to viscous essence, to (with ((forever, new) eyes) (always (see (that which is necessary, no more)))).</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When it finally passes, when my eyes are at last my own, I’m in a bafflingly comfortable part of the sewers. A little underground one-room safehouse beside a Chalked-up halfpipe creek of this morning’s stormwater. There are shelves of clean pajamas and neat hampers of dirty ones. There is a Cup-Noodle vending machine and a water dispenser in the corner. There are two full bathrooms. Wordlessly, for there is absolutely nothing to say, we shower off the filth of Wu Ke Nai He and take kitty-corner bunks. I try, but don’t know if sleep is possible in my state.</span></p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“Mona?”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“Yeah.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“Is that really what she’s like?”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It takes me a minute to unwind this. He means <i>Deng</i>, which means he <i>had </i>seen her, which means — I’m too tired to follow the implications just now — the Ripples managed to put us into loop-lock together...</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“She’s not all that bad.” This, muffled, through my pillow. “I bet she’ll like you.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“...”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“...Tethi?”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“Yeah.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“Is this place real? Is this really happening to us right now?”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He peers down from the upper bunk, his face in bright orange relief, too bright. He laughs softly, sleepily. “I don’t honestly know.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“...”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“...”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“Tethi?”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“Yeah.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“Can we turn off the Cup-Noodle vending machine?”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He turns away to snuggle up with the rollscroll. “You’re down there. Do you want to try?”</span></p>\n</section>",

            "content_html": "<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">Of course I should have expected Yao. Tethi and I get lots of badly-concealed glances when we step onto the Safety floor the next morning, but Yao’s the one to come greet me. Which makes me feel terrible.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You look terrible, Mona,” he tells me bluntly. “Everyone’s wondering where you’ve been.” And if he hates me, how could I blame him? I called in a four-oh-eight on him, got him sent to Medical, and then disappeared for an entire week to chase the very same strand of madness. I think he sees that, somehow. Sees it as a vindication, somehow. His head swivels past me now. “Wait, is that —?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Hello.” Tethi waves sheepishly from the water fountain. “I remember you.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“He’s visiting for the day,” I tell Yao quickly, as if that explains anything. “Listen, I’m sorry for what happened last week, and that I’ve been away, and...<i>there is something,</i>” I go on, voice lowered, “<i>about the Sieve. That’s why he’s here —</i>”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It’s all right,” Yao brushes me off. “You did the right thing. I went quadratic, and you made the right call. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d rather not hear whatever it is you want to say.” And he strides away.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tethi and I exchange an uneasy look. Good lord, the Bureau did a number on him.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We find Deng and Rui in the corner conference room, as arranged. For Deng and I, this is familiar ground: it’s hardly the first time I’ve dropped off for a week, refusing to answer or even look at my emails. But usually I don’t return with a friend, or with the lure of groundbreaking experimental data. She greets me with commingled <i>where the hell have you been</i> and <i>I’m so glad you’re all right.</i> Rui lopes over, enthusiastically shakes Tethi’s hand (“<i>Mm-bey-teh-thi</i>, do I have that right?”) and offers me a reassuring nod.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tethi is not dressed for the job he wants. The YINS researchers walking by are in athleisure and graphic tees, struggling to manage even half a hairdo. He’s in bootleg Docs, dress slacks, a creamsicle-paisley buttondown. Deng looks him over and then addresses me. “So this is a friend of yours?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“A colleague,” Tethi corrects, with a collegial smile.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“A researcher,” I add uselessly. Briefly I look her in the eyes, and my gut drops out with the memory of what it felt like to go unseen and disappear. “You might also remember him as our first Sunflower Sieve patient. He and I have something we think the two of you will want to see.” And what I don’t say is<i>: Do you know? Do you know that there’s something out there wearing your face?</i> In the six hours since we climbed out of the sewer, I’ve felt nonstop stings of panic every time I see a Mirror Sea camera over my shoulder. The horrible feeling of that <i>thing</i> watching me from just behind some gauzy veil, ready and willing at any moment to rip me back into that endless field of sunflowers. And then, even worse, that when I’m out of its view I may simply slip away.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Rui leans forward with interest, just as Deng leans back in her chair. Sometimes I wonder if she’s learned to flash her glasses that way on purpose. “Well, we’re here. Have at it.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Esteemed professors,” Tethi begins, and means it. He takes a deep breath — there’s still so much we haven’t gone over. “Thank you for the opportunity to present our work. It pertains to the events that have troubled the neikotics community since they came to light this morning.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A beat. “We were there,” I add.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Deng’s face goes white. “You were <i>there?</i>”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Of course the word is out. Hundreds of neikonauts at Wu Ke Nai He fell into that same trance — and, sure, that’s not exactly front-page news. What’s unusual is the <i>way</i> they fell into the sunflowers — not transfixed by a Ripple, but forced into it by what they describe as primer tiles, flashed by a dazzling reflective structure in the Sea. Stranger still are rumors that the Weather Bureau took scores of non-neikonauts into medical veetles, where some remember sitting inside a UTMS scanner, for unclear reasons, for the first time in their lives. There has been no official word from the Bureau or Blue Delta, and so there has been no official response from YINS. But it’s on tip of our tongues, lodged in our throats: we are in danger. As a precaution, the Mirror Sea displays across Beiwan Ward have gone black.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This same morning, across the city in Hongqiao South, a middle school science teacher rose with an early alarm. He dragged his telescope up to the rooftop and snapped a beautiful photo of the moon, harvest gold, rich contrast along the rabbit. Then he swiveled the lens down past the horizon towards the side of a Super Eight motel — perhaps something caught his eye, or perhaps this is his habit — and produced a second, strikingly similar image. <i>The Moon in the Sea,</i> his plaintive caption reads. By mid-morning his paired images had thousands of shares, thousands of comments: <i>The Vast-Cold Palace Alights Upon Our Banks</i> or simply <i>Anyone Know What The Fuck This Is?</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Well, Tethi and I know what it is. He starts at the beginning, no secrets, no deception. Where he lives, why he lives there, what he saw when he tiled into stolen feeds from Wu Ke Nai He. Okay, we gloss over some parts. My professors listen — Deng’s lips tight, Rui’s fingers tented — until Tethi gets to the part where, on the damp of his floor, we ran Deng and Rui’s failed experiment for the second time in two decades. We found evidence of Sunflower Sieve debris reaching through words, through eye contact, reacting across minds. We —</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I showed you that video <i>in confidence!</i>” Deng finally interjects.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It was an experiment.” I keep my voice low and level. Focus on the data. I don’t want a blowout. “You said that the two of you couldn’t get it to work. Well, we’re telling you now that it does.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“We’ll see about that.” She folds her arms. Rui offers a gesture, to her, to us: <i>careful, calm</i>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tethi looks to me for support, and hell, I told him it might go this way. But it can’t be easy, being chewed out by one of your scientific heroes. It barely gets easier with time. Slowly, he lays out the parameters of a larger experiment. He does not condescend to Deng and Rui: he tells the story with impulse responses and correlation matrices. He slides a pair of Introspecs across the table —</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And Deng’s eyes flash. “You were <i>selling </i>these?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Well,” Tethi tries helplessly to lighten the mood. “We were hardly going to give them away.”</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">“You know this is a <i>massive</i> violation of the YINS research ethics code?” Deng ignores him entirely. She leans across the table, her gaze boring into mine. Her voice is soft, steady, cold. “Do you know that I’m compelled by the bylaws of this institution to report you for running an experiment like this without the subjects’ consent?”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">“<i>Please</i>. Let them finish.” Rui shoots me a laden glance. “Let’s see what they have to say.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">“In some ways,” Tethi continues, now with a nervous edge, “I think you already know the rest of the story. There was a massive correlation event at Wu Ke Nai He. We have neikotic evidence that, whatever was in the Mirror Sea, there was a...corresponding structure...operating across minds last night. What we have here is a composite of the sensor data, from almost a hundred headsets. From neikonauts, and...not.” He clears his throat. “I wonder if a brief primer on the popular mythology of the Mirror Sea is in order. Have you both heard the term <i>hyperlagmites?</i>”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">“Yes,” Rui replies. He’s leaning in to get a better look at the Ripples’ handiwork, at the world’s first real application of soberware. Half-awed, half-devastated, and totally transfixed.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">I spent hours on this next slide, and I’m a little pleased that Rui gasps when he sees it. The UTMS electrodes on the Introspecs were cheap, but in combination they worked like a telescope array tuned to a powerful frequency, clearly resolving that skeletal network of Sieve debris. As our unwitting subjects moved deeper into the crowd, it revealed hyperlagmites, high spires of debris, slow shapes moving among these that we didn’t dare name. Our images of the Ripples’ city come as a short, looping video. It’s low-res, monochrome, but chillingly clear. There in the dead center, a white-hot spherical blot, is the Sunflower Sieve. The thing that put all those neikonauts into loop-lock at once.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">“If it can be said to be anything specific, anything earthly at all...” And my voice is positively shaking now. “We think the Ripples have built a Deng Bridge.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">For a long while no one speaks. Tethi flips to the next slide — which just reads <i>THANK YOU</i> — and neither of us know quite where to look. Perhaps a PowerPoint was not the way to deliver this news.</span></p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“This doesn’t prove anything,” Deng insists, finally breaking the silence. “It’s insane. Mona, be serious about this.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“Well, what’s <i>your </i>theory?” It’s grating to me how she barely even acknowledges that Tethi’s in the room. “We come to you immediately with this, and <i>that’s</i> your reaction? Don’t you think a teeny, tiny bit of speculation is in order here?”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>She tries not to, but she sneers back. “Listen carefully, because I don’t want to explain it twice. You have some neikotic readings, questionably acquired, of a mass gathering. Shared aural and visual stimuli easily explain these high baseline levels of correlation. Your data is highly overfit to your outlandish theory. I note that drug use was most likely involved. There are some pretty pictures here, some nasty collages of neikotic debris. But it doesn’t add up to anything coherent. You have to see that.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I find the slide that, to me, shows the Ripples’ city most clearly. I try to see it afresh, without bias or preconception. I can’t, of course. But you <i>have</i> to see the spires, the dwellings — even, if you know how to look, wispy hints of the Ripples themselves. “What does this look like to you?”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“I don’t know,” Deng replies, her voice meticulously, vacuously calm. “What does it look like to you?” I open my mouth and she cuts me off, fishes for a stylus. “Wait! Let me write this down. I’d like to include it in my report to the ethics board.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It’s going to be a blowout. Last week of September, right on schedule. And this time we have an audience.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Oh, fuck it, I might as well.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“Level with me for once,” I match that iciness. I reach for my bag. “What, exactly, is <i>this</i>?”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Deng and Rui glance at the Sunflower-I patch, then at each other, then at me. And now Deng is on her feet, not exactly looming over the table, but terrifying all the same. Something in her face, a deep-set stability to those wrinkles and lines, has broken. “<i>How dare you,</i>” she snarls. “After everything I’ve done for you? After I plucked you from a miserable life in your sad, senescent excuse for a country? After I put up with <i>years</i> of your laziness, your antics, your childish inability to focus? After I delicately <i>hold your little hand</i> and walk you to publication? <i>This is how you repay me?</i>”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">She grips the table so hard that her fingers are shaking. I cast around for Rui, for Tethi —</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“The Ripples have a city,” Tethi interjects. Quickly, but calmly, all things considered. “They have material culture, in the deeper correlations, in a hidden corner of the Sea. It’s built from neikotic debris. The Sunflower Sieve is one of their experiments. Take us to the Observatory and we’ll show you.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Deng finally turns to face him with a prim smile. “And just who the fuck are you?”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“I think we should go up there,” Rui offers mildly. He was actually on his tablet a moment before, taking notes, reading the fucking news or something, but I guess he was paying attention after all. “There’s a simple solution to this.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Deng tightens her grin. “The Observatory has a rather high bar for research proposals, Dr. Rui.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Rui smiles back. “You have to admit, Dr. Deng, that they’d be fascinated by the hypothesis.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And somehow, it’s settled. We ride the elevator wordlessly up one floor. Rui leads, Deng follows, we trail. He gives us one long glance backwards which I decide to read as approving, and then keeps his eyes dead ahead. Deng is fixated on something in the middle distance. <i>I’m sorry,</i> I mouth to Tethi. My arms are shaking. <i>That was insane.</i> He raises his eyebrows, but barely seems flustered. He can see the prize. I suppose he’s seen worse.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We push through the lobby and cross the leafy zigzag trails of the quad for Building 6. On the ride to the top floor, I consider that I might see Cai. How unhinged I’ll look, marching back in with a whole team to validate my delusion. <i>But it’s not a delusion.</i> The parabola realigns. <i>I know what I saw in there, and I’m not afraid of the knowing.</i> And surely the Observatory must, at least, have their own suspicions. Surely, in all those tight timetables, on all those scanner beds, they must have noticed <i>something</i>?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And then it all clicks. It hurts, badly, how I had all the pieces. How I could have put them together at any time but I never did, not until the elevator doors open on the right visual cue. These blank white walls. After all those close calls, after all our work...<i>I led him right here.</i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“I think it’s just to the left,” Rui suggests hoarsely.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“Teth,” I whisper. “<i>Run.</i>”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He’s already running. He’s too slow. There’s a joke about how you never see more than two Weather Bureau agents at the same time. Like there’s only a few of them flitting around. Four burst now from an unmarked door, in their visors and grey bulletproof silk. It doesn’t take that many to subdue Tethi.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>“By the authority of the Special Provision for Psychological Safety, Ward Council Edict 131, you are hereby under arrest.”</i> Do they really need four? Two to pin him down, the third to draw a vialgun and inject him with antipattern sedative, and the fourth to read him the conditions of his detainment? The voice from their visors is artificially high, somehow reflective in its own right. <i>“You will be held until such time as your own psychological safety, and that of those you truck with, can be assured according to the mechanisms and evaluation guidelines of Edict 131, section six, paragraph two...”</i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He’s already out. His arms dangle limply. My stomach sinks through the floor.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“You’d better take me too,” I hiss. At Deng? At Rui? They both look unsurprised, vaguely dismayed, as Tethi is dragged back through the door. “I was every bit as involved. That experiment was my idea.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“But you didn’t sell the Sunflower Sieve,” Rui tells me flatly. “Which, as he himself pointed out, is Ripple technology.” He leads us through swinging double doors into the Observatory’s dim, domed theater.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“Rui —”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“I can’t do this anymore, Deng. She’s already at the very center of it. It’s time she knows.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It takes a skipped beat of the heart to be sure they’re talking about me. It takes the courage of one last breath to step into their crossfire and interrupt them. I’m shaking all over, vibrating with nerves and adrenaline and now, rage, preemptive rage at Dr. Deng. “It’s time she knows <i>what</i>?”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“Well, where to begin?” Rui runs his hand over his head, through phantom hair. “That your advisor was a close confidant of Xia Zitian? A consultant, for years, training neikonauts within the Mirror Sea project? That we brought her back to Shanghai on condition that she tell us what she knows? Help us manage the second Sea?”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“You didn’t <i>bring</i> me anywhere,” Deng insists.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“That she <i>won’t</i>?” Rui ignores her, raising his voice. His echo crashes back down from the dome. “That she’s been stonewalling on anything related to the Mirror Sea? Pretending her work under Xia never existed? Fussing with the trimmings of the loop-lock virtual machine as the Ripples regain their —”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“<i>Turn the cameras off!” </i>She roars. “The Bureau wants my advice? <i>Here’s my advice: </i>you’re worse than the Ripplechasers, worse than the fucking Chalkers. You’ve gone as quadratic as any of them, and they couldn’t do it without you. You sick freaks just can’t stop <i>peering</i> into it, <i>looking</i> harder, <i>daring</i> it...” She runs out of breath for a long moment. Venom, too. That anger is fear now. A pleading, nearly whispered fear. “Turn — the — cameras — off.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Rui, calmly, sadly: “You know we would if we could.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“I don’t believe that for a second,” she snaps back. “Not for a damn second. Mona, let’s go.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But Rui has unlocked a door in the back of the Observatory, and he’s holding it open. The offer takes shape in long, silent glances between the three of us. From me, devastated and confused, hungry for something just out of sight. From Rui, flatly irritated, hurried by an unseen drumbeat, but obviously curious for my reaction. From Deng, wild, desperate, and drowning…</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“Mona, I never wanted this for you, I wanted —”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I don’t look back. I close the door and follow him inside.</span></p>\n</section>",

            "content_html": "<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">The machine at Stanford was dangerous in a number of ways, and the Institutional Review Board was finding more every day. It was my job to fill out the forms that they’d send up to our dry but meticulously dust-free stucco lab at the edge of campus. They would have questions — about voltages, dose-response curves, psychological baselines — and I became adept at answering them in Deng’s voice, with her trademark deflection. It was not that I had to lie to them about what we planned to do with a UTMS scanner and industrial quantities of DMT. But I did have to fashion a kind of viscous bubble of confusion around the project. Sludgy narrative tar-traps that the IRB would count their waking hours against and eventually give in to. I learned from the best.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Okay, they have questions about eye strain,” I would shout across the lab, during early autumn afternoons when I should have been in class. “They want to know how many lumens the headset gives off. And whether we can shift the colors off the blue side of the spectrum.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Then that descending whir as Dr. Deng shut down the scanner bed and crawled out from under it. “Do you think,” she would grumble, brandishing a multimeter, “that they understand what it is we’re trying to do here?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Six of us had to sign special waivers from the university, the city of Palo Alto, the state of California and its quasi-sovereign candy shell. We had been drawn from the fat intersection of Stanford’s giant cognitive science department and its even larger circle of drug enthusiasts. We had been trained on the fundamentals: processor architecture and qualia-wave mechanics and the teachings of Zhuangzi. We were to be the first neikonauts west of the Mississippi. I was the youngest by far.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You first,” we’d mutter to each other, only half kidding, watching the engineers add ramshackle patches and eleventh-hour coolant tubes to the machine. YINS had shipped an entire Kanwei Python all the way from Shanghai for us to train on, but it arrived in shattered pieces, reeking of foul play. This set Deng back about five minutes. She bought a regular transcranial magnetic stimulation bed and fashioned it into the thing we needed. Charging its supercapacitors had, several times, knocked out the soccer field’s floodlights.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>the end, I went third. I took an evening time slot, and was at the lab just as the sun disappeared behind the foothills. There had been no mailing list chatter about the day’s first two sessions, which I took to mean they hadn’t gone well. The look on Deng’s face confirmed this as I arrived. Her technicians were visible, barely, inside a maze of matte black Dell monitors. A lot was riding on tonight.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Are you ready?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In our final days of training she had steered us away from the technical stuff and begun to pump us full of koans. Those rattled between my ears as I was fitted with sensors and tubes. <i>Two fields of poppies grow side-by-side. </i>I would have been muttering this to myself as they tightened the visor around my head.<i> Why do they not grow together?</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Then I was supine in powder-blue scrubs, alone in the scanner room. Voices in my ear plowed steadily through checklists and failsafes.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Point two seven five milligrams per second squared, standard curve.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Manifold pre-lock in nine…eight…”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Deng’s voice cut into a countdown just then, staccato and nervous, a recitation in classical Chinese: “Between man and butterfly there is necessarily a distinction.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>This woman.</i> I had never met anyone like her: she held this entire loop-lock system in her head, had designed it half from scratch in six months. There was nothing happening in this room that she didn’t fully understand. I smiled and allowed myself to relax. “This transition is called the transformation of material things.” I finished the verse, barely, feeling my tongue go thick.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">STAND BY FOR TILES.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The DMT hit my bloodstream almost immediately. My vision, my headspace, went symmetric and insectoid and alien. It was always like this, the feeling that I had been away a long time, and was finally coming home. But I had to remember: tonight would be different. I let the drug move me but soon I began to move back, feeling out the depths in my vision to hallucinate the clockwork of a processor, my finger its metronome. <i>I’m thinking like the computer and the computer is thinking like me. </i>Deng had said we would have to meet it a little more than halfway.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And then, from the visor, light. Solid red, of the very center of the earth, which melted smoothly into magmatic orange and yellow. Eruption to the surface, to interlocking fields of lime and emerald, and then into sky blue, deepest sapphire and indigo, then the violet of night, of the stars behind the stars. Then red again. The cycle gathered speed, and I knew that I was mirroring it, that the colors would continue behind closed eyelids. And I knew there was a mental move I needed to make, an assertion of something like control…</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>RED. Red red red red red.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I grasped, and the cycle ground to a halt. <i>Red red red red red. </i>Magnets clicked and warbled unhappily at my temples. I blinked my eyes closed and there it was, roiling, howling, untold fathoms of loon-eyed malice. Open again and the same color exactly, stuttering in tight styxward spirals. <i>Red red red red.</i> It was all there was, this knowing glowing campfire <i>red</i>, not scarlet or crimson or cardinal but <i>red red red</i> just <i>red</i> it closed around me, thumping through me, drowning thought and sensation, rising past my high-water mark, any scrawled notch of past psychosis. I was breaking myself to become this color to perceive it to venerate it to actualize the concept of it. I was the very conduit by which it became reality, a brutally simple solution to a hard problem. I would never be anything else but <i>red,</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>red red red red red</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>red red red blue red</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">No thinking or remembering just now, but knowing: that this particular moment had been the focus of all our neikonaut training. There was a kernel of something else, shrinking fast, in the center of all this <i>red</i>, but I to focus elsewhere focus just past it. <i>There is another color. </i>This was scrawled on a chalkboard once, and she had us recite it, chant it eyes-on-eyes until we gasped for air, until we broke from sleep screaming it to terrified roommates. <i>There is another color.</i> It <i>red </i>was <i>red</i> impossible <i>red</i> to <i>red </i>believe <i>red</i> it, but we simply had to believe it, and believe that believing it would make it true. <i>There is another color.</i> There was a different frequency, maybe. A background note of summerday, discordant in its beauty.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There <i>is</i> another color.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There is <i>another</i> color.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There is another <i>color.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That thought spread out like a Cheshire smile. It was working, and because it was working, it was working. I was about to invent another color.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Red red red red</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Red blue red red</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Red blue red blue</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Red blue blue blue</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And I believed it into existence, that next tile. It burst cloudless and heavendeep into the visor, a wide-open resonator for birdsong, <i>blue blue blue blue blue </i>of tears of relief of possibility because I was thinking like the computer and the computer was thinking like me and two things were enough, you could build everything out of that. <i>Blue blue blue blue</i> bluebell bluebird blueberry I hit terminal velocity and could have fallen through that <i>blue</i> all night. But training was really kicking in, the registers and busways of the processor searing deeper into my mind. I was ready to do it again.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Blue blue blue blue GREEN.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I came down to as much applause as ten people could possibly muster. There was hooting and cheering and a tear or two. The postdocs stamped their feet, clasped their hands, scrubbed the footage. Onscreen they circled the twists in my ‘folds that appeared as I mastered the color changes: from red to blue to green to yellow and soon in any order I pleased. Deng stood in the back, beaming at me, but she put a hand over my glass after my first sip of champagne.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“That was just one tile,” she said of my loop-lock session. Not dismissively; conspiratorially. She was ready for more. “Think you could manage four?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It was the first day of my life.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<p class=\"p1\">Deng concluded that it was safer to build a second scanner than to move this one from the edge of campus. The engineers grumbled about how much work this would be, all the grant money they’d need to spend, how much smaller and more elegant this new iteration could be. December came and went. I failed two of my classes, and Deng yanked hard on some strings to keep me off probation, so I could do six sessions a day tiling deeper into the machine. In the moment I felt I made this choice lucidly. It sure felt good to be her favorite. Her favorite <i>what,</i> though?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Student, maybe: we spent hours together, poring over the history and theory and culture of neikotics. <i>In Shanghai,</i> half her sentences began. She unpacked dusty boxes of voxelite whatsits and claimed that there were deep reserves of knowledge lurking inside. Perhaps I was her favorite…test subject? Sometimes that felt more accurate, especially as I struggled to grasp the blackboard math of what was happening in her machine. She was oddly cavalier about that: <i>it will all make sense in loop-lock.</i> One session, a pre-lock hook failed and I was treated to a plain old bad DMT trip, immobilized by panic and foam-lined restraints. Deng herself pulled me from the scanner and asked me a litany of questions, rushing quickly past <i>are you alright</i> towards <i>can you make this motion with your fist</i> and <i>please blink your eyes left-left right-right, </i>as though she had tweezed me from the motherboard to test for defects. Maybe I was her favorite <i>part.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It was the middle of April of my junior year. The second scanner was more reliable but somehow even louder, so when we wheeled it into a lecture hall for a demonstration, we kept the first six rows empty. Deng began by introducing me, and I peeked out of the tube to applause and general mirth. She had a magician’s stage presence, and she used it to explain how a certain encryption scheme had long been considered unbreakable, but tonight, <i>but tonight. </i>Tonight<i> </i>I will saw this young woman in half. “What you’re seeing on the projector is what Mona is seeing now on the visor,” I heard her say. “As she makes contact with the computer these patterns will become more and more detailed, until they become pixel dust, a map of a world that only she can see.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And then I was gone and I was back to a standing ovation. Whatever I did in there made a lot of VCs very happy, and some of them approached me discretely at the reception. <i>We love Deng,</i> they said. <i>We all love Deng,</i> <i>but we’re looking for someone a little more aligned with our strategic concerns. If we gave you a lab, do you think you could rebuild it?</i> I was so drunk that I was glowing, and I joked that I would try.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The next afternoon Deng led me on a walk back out by the Dish, to tell me she was leaving. She stopped me mid-pleasantry and blurted it out. “I’ve been offered a position at YINS.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I blinked back.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“The Yangtze Institute of Neikotic Studies, in Shanghai.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“No, I know what it is, but...when? Are you going to take it?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Last night, and this autumn, and yes, I am, Mona. Stanford has been what it needed to be, but I’ve been away from home for far too long.” We took ten long strides up a cresting hill, past the wildgrass. Deng kicked a rock through this silence, double-balancing a mental ledger, finding some dram of courage, and spoke. “In turn, I am offering you a position as my student.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You want <i>me</i> to come with you?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I...yes. I do.” She flashed that tired smile of hers and then rushed on. “There would be logistics to manage, and a great deal to catch you up on, and your Mandarin needs a certain degree of improvement, but I think it would be good. For both of us. I could use someone like you around.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Dr Deng.” And here the obvious struck me. “I’m a junior. I have a year left here.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Yes, well...from the perspective of YINS, that’s no problem. You would begin as a first-year doctoral student.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I have classes to finish. I have to write a <i>thesis</i>, or something, I think. Or I won’t get a degree.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“You’ll get another one.” She sounded awfully chipper about this. “A better one. I’m working with the assumption that you want to be a neikonaut. Right? And if so, there’s nowhere better to be than Shanghai. In a lot of ways, there’s nowhere else. Mona, the scanner that I built here is, I’m sorry, it’s garbage. It’s a bucket of parts. You have not tasted the first spoonful of what a person can do in loop-lock. Or to work among those who really understand the mind in neikotic terms. That is on the table for you now.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“This fall?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“This fall.” She was insistent here. “The neikotics program at Stanford is not going to survive in any form I can condone. When I leave, the vultures from Sand Hill Road are going to pick it clean of postdocs. If this is what you want...” And it was. She knew it was, it was all she had to say. “...then this is it.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I asked if I could think about it. She told me that, given what a big decision it was, I would have until the end of the week. I tried to think it all the way through, but my surroundings were already shrinking in the rearview mirror. My parents? My bare handful of friends here? A long time ago, I imagined a degree from Stanford was the thing, and maybe the only thing, that would make me happy. More recently I hoped it would make me sane. But what was it, really? A piece of paper with my name on it? A life jacket to keep my head above water, circulating clockwise around the filth of the Bay? I already knew so much about YINS that I would be embarrassed to admit it to Deng. I hadn’t even needed to tamp down the thought, because you needed to be a <i>genius</i> to go to there. But it was on the table.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I think you’d like Shanghai,” she mused, as stopped for a break, resting against a fence. “You know, whole months go by in Palo Alto where I feel only half-awake. Half-alive, even. <i>Don’t worry, it’ll be over soon</i>, should be the motto here<i>.</i> You never feel like that in Shanghai. There’s always something to see, to eat, to do. Some decision to make.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I’ve heard some crazy things about Shanghai.” Wasn’t it run by street gangs that spent their entire lives in some kind of drugged-out ritualistic trance? How’s that for<i> half-awake?</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Deng snorted. She really did. “That’s mostly hearsay and propaganda. Internal propaganda as much as anything, you know. The ruling party makes a big deal out of the stranger elements because they’ve deemed it good for tourism.” She began to lapse into Mandarin here. “The truth is that Shanghai has worn many faces, been through a great deal, and it’s always kept the same heart.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Why did you leave?” It was a question I’d never thought to ask. I felt bad about that, suddenly.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“I’m sorry?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Shanghai. It sounds like it means a lot to you. Why did you leave to begin with?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It’s a long, boring, and <i>very </i>political story.” Deng laughed, and then she gestured up the trail — <i>time to keep moving.</i> Just over the next hill, Stanford’s great radio telescope gleamed in the setting sun. “I’ll tell you some other time.”</p>\n</section>",
